Their idea was simple - we can't just talk to make the change, we must take
action. They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and challenge
police brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the
government and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party
""the greatest threat to the internal security of the country"". They tried to close
it, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was
dissolved.
50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country
stills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. It spreads through all the country
like the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We
need a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that
can make Black Lives really matter.

CNN.
So, Bernie has the point. I appreciate the way he maintains his independent
opinion in spite of all the pressure that is on him as the ""second Democratic
option"". Because that is a fact. The Clinton Foundation is nothing more than
an ""organized crime"" at it's finest, in which we are investing our taxpayers'
money!
Hillary has no problem in accepting foreign money from the countries, like
Saudi Arabia. Hillary has no remorse about taking money from countries that
abuse the rights of women, while she has always had her own alleged
feminist stance. She does not refrain from receiving money from the countries
that prosecute, torture and execute LGBT on the legal basis, although Hillary
has always been a ""defender"" of the minorities.
So, why are so many people going to vote for her? That's a secret for me.

Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of

ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the
location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on
the passenger's side.
When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the
situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man
briefly lying unconscious on the ground.
The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows
that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?

present economic or social advancement plans to president Obama, yet we
refused and let anti- blacks trick us into thinking that was not elected to
benefit just black people alone. President Obama was elected for a reason.
He was the stepping stone for blacks to rise but it was blown away. Now, it is
the time of White America to rebuild and advance and make their race great.
The war for power between blacks and whites is very real, but the black
community has forgotten. Consequently, the power of black is fading day by
day because those in position are descending from the ladder every day. In
no time; ""White Power' will be stronger than before.

?WARNING!!!? In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in
a public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense
altercation with a student.
According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim,
Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom.
The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a
brief clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him.
I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more
then a bunch of bullies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever
happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an
officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide
something and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also, is not
destruction of evidence a crime?

carnage. The wounded include seven police officers and two civilians. The
sniper, Micah X. Johnson was a black U.S. military veteran of the Afghan war.
As he was captured, he claimed he wanted to ""kill white people"".
There's no evidence that he was a Black Lives Matters activist. There's no
proof that he was into the movement anyhow. It happened almost a week ago
and the police can't show anything to prove there was a link between Micah
X. Johnson and Black Lives matter. But the Main stream media are telling us
time and again that Â«black lives matter terrorists are killing the police officersÂ».
The main stream Media are telling us, that the protest against police terror is

wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,
karma's coming back for blue pigs!
A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police
officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two
officers for seemingly no reason.
The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two
school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza
shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of
police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally
nothing without using their guns.
Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their
own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and
electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing their job."" All those things and
more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my
rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.
Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine
about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is
why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our
ancestors did it for centuries.
Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will change. Amen.",https://www.facebook.com/Dont-Shoot-1157233400960126/,United States: Louisiana,N/A,18 - 65+,N/A,"News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

problems we face happen because we've stopped calling things by their
names and the assassination of cops in Dallas was no exception. We're
hiding behind political correctness and denying the truth because we don't
want to `offend' someone.
And the truth is: a group of people calling their supporters to commit violence
is not a peaceful group. A group of people coming to their opponent's rallies
and attacking peaceful people is a group of extremists. A group of people
standing behind the attack on police is a group of terrorists. The Black Lives

arrested and charged with public nuisance and unlawful assembly. Since July
7, the day after which Castile was fatally shot to death, sympathizers have
been embarking on demonstration outside the governor's home but police
officers are asking the protesters out of the premises because they are
blocking the streets. This request seemed not successful, therefore the
protesters stood against the officers. According to the governor, the protestors
are welcomed to stay because he had no problem with them being there.
Even though the street was cleared few days after July 18, some protesters
have returned to the premises to continue the demonstration.

That's a fact that US police officers are bad trained. Cops are programmed to
take innocent lives. Cops here in America play God. They believe they are
judge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law,
it is their job to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot
someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their
eyes.
It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the
difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will
get away with it.
In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand
that their job is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,
they understand that they are not the jury and this is not their job.

Their idea was simple - we can't just talk to make the change, we must take
action. They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and challenge
police brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the
government and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party
""the greatest threat to the internal security of the country"". They tried to close
it, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was
dissolved.
50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country
stills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. It spreads through all the country
like the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We
need a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that
can make Black Lives really matter.
