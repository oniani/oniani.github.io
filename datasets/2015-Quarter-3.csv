and magazines having to do with LGBTQ and political issues.
They accused her of misconduct for having an expired tube of toothpaste and
for brushing food off the table. They placed her in a solitary confinement — a
torturous, extremely distressing experience. The whole cruel, corrupted
system is against her.
It looks like military prosecutors view Manning in a way that means she must
be ""broken"" or forcefully assimilated because of her crime —first, because she
exposed the government's crimes, and government really doesn't like it, and
second, because she's trans.
Their goal is to see that Manning is as dehumanized as possible, but it's clear
who the real non-humans are. Someone has gone to great lengths to paint
Chelsea as a deceitful and psychotic character.
But how many of those punishing Manning should themselves be in a psych
ward?
Transphobia is a one ugly thing. So sad when heroes like Chelsea Manning

442,"The threat of possible ISIS attacks on the U.S. Military families has risen
U.S. Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado said in a statement
that he was alarmed by the reports of an FBI alert that relatives of the US
military personnel in Wyoming and Colorado were harassed outside their
homes by Middle Eastern men and might have been under surveillance. A
copy of the alert said that the wife of a U.S. military member was approached
in front of her home in Colorado by two men. The incident took place in May.
Similar incidents in Wyoming repeated in June.
We see that the threat of possible ISIS attack on families of the U.S. military
has risen. And when the threat is so real the US intelligence agencies are
doing nothing. As a matter of the fact they don't fully perform their duties.
First of all, the US security forces should take all appropriate measures to
identify people who scour after the wives and children of the U.S. Military.
Secondly, families of the U.S. Military should be taken under special
protection of the police and the FBI. If even one hair of the U.S. Military family
members will be lost then the work of American secret services isn't worth a
dime as they cannot maintain security on the American soil. In case of a
negative scenario there won't be any need in their work. And this will be the
final nail in the coffin of the American secret services.
Let's remember the last FBI and NSA failures, such as failure to stop the
Boston Marathon Bombings and so on. Our soldiers fight for America at the

Autistic Teen Unconscious
During the incident, Abrams, 17, suffered two seizures after police used force
against him at the Green Line's Lexington Parkway Station.
The teen suffers from Asperger's syndrome, which causes him to strongly
dislike being touched or having people in his person space, and is considered
legally blind, wearing extremely magnified glasses.
Officers thought the non-compliance of Abrams was reason enough to justify
forcibly taking him down, which resulted in him being battered and left
unconscious.
Abrams non-compliance wasn't done out of malice, but out of not really
understanding the situation, and believing he hadn't done anything wrong.
Abrams' autism makes it extremely difficult for him to interpret the intentions
or feelings of others, according to his mother. Police released the teen to the
custody of his mother rather than take him to the juvenile detention facility.

448,"The Census Bureau published the new data in its International Data Base,
which contains population estimates and projections up to the year 2050. The
figure from the Census Bureau is a calculation of net migration—meaning the
total number of immigrants who will arrive in the United States in 2015 would
actually be larger than 1.24 million.
Of course, the United States is the country of immigrants. But if America had
huge undeveloped lands and needed workers at the earliest stage, today
there is a jobs deficit. Today the government must restrict immigration that is
a reason of interethnic tensions in the United States. High unemployment rate
fuels intolerance toward immigrants that are ready to work illegally for low
wages. So, besides social problem, immigrants threaten the U.S. economy.
Those who work illegaly don't pay taxes that are an important part of state
budget. Working illegaly, they break the law. Lack of immigration restrictions
increases crime rates.
Moreover, more and more immigrants cannot speak English. One-fifth of
people in the United States speak a foreign language at home, according to a
report of the Center for Immigration Studies.
You see, increasing ammount of immigrants in the United States creates
social and economic problems. However, we have a risk not only to worsen
the U.S. economy, but also to lose our culture. America can't be the Tower of
Babel, we cannot allow everybody to live here if immigration threatens us. We

has emerged to demand justice and political attention. However, the everyday
racism we see was not understood, but ignored. Moreover, the government

never penalizes any religious institution that refuses to recognize a same-sex
couple's marriage, or employ them, house them, or serve them.

reasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these
people's circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats.
It is very important for every transgender to be able to change his\her
identification to reflect who they really are. It's not just about person dressed
as a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is
about much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man
or woman only presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they
were assigned to at birth.
Transgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification
changes. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible.
Because it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you
were assigned to at birth.
Please share your stories with us, because united we can stand against
injustice and inequality!

there's no doubt in our minds she is a supporter of the LGBT community.
And of course this world always need an amazing power of woman's touch:-)
Isn't it just amazing? Wonder Woman presides over the wedding of two
brides in Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman, Chapter 48 written
and illustrated by Jason Badower.
Badower said he also really wanted to reference current affairs in the story -
specifically, legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide.
""I saw this Wonder Woman story as an incredible opportunity to have one of
the most recognizable, iconic characters in the world to be among the first to
step forward and officially endorse this new law,"" he said. ""I thought, let's not
just have Wonder Woman embrace this new law, let's have her celebrate it.""
Some may ask — why is it so important when superheroes depicted as
supporters of marriage equality? Because it is a massive, land-mark
milestone in LBGTQ rights history.
Because the fight to get to normal was so difficult, and because the fight to
change normal is still ongoing. Just like Wonder Woman using her
superpowers to struggle with violence and injustice of the world! :-)

431,"Barack Obama and his team have spent two months working to secure 41
percent for Iran deal. And now they claim enourmous victory.
Under the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the
Senate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect — a legally binding long-
term agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of
dollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed.
Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been
obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can
never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in
2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and
the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama.
But Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to change a
subject to a vote — not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be
treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and
the Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his
presidential veto.
The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to
overturn such a veto — and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So,
instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67
senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or
more Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to
support the deal.
Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will
simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking
and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42
percent.
Barack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn't care
about Americans. All what he cares is his outsized ambitions.",https://www.facebook.com/patriototus,United States,N/A,18 - 65+,N/A,"News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

States across the country were filled with flows of refugees since Obama

states that 437,829 new refugees came to the USA since Obama first took
office. Most of them were placed in Texas (46,351), California (44,162) and
New York (26,293). Many of refugees were placed in Ohio (14,855), Florida
(21,613), Virginia (9,395), Colorado (11,300) and Nevada (3,421).
Such active provision of a shelter for refugees sooner or later will lead to the
fact that the number of terrorist attacks in the USA will increase. The US
Homeland Security Committee considers that the administration is admitting
too many refugees from Iraq and Syria, a hotbed of ISIS terrorism. Perhaps
new terrorist attacks won't be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more

We all said a prayer for the victims and went back to studies. But a few
minutes later all students began receiving calls from their relatives. My mom

She spoke about her own personal experience so far as a transgender

The famous African-American writer Ta-Nehisi Coates grew up in West
Baltimore with people who lost a child whether to the streets, to guns or to jail.
Today, his goal is to protect his son from the different forms of violence that
he experienced in school and on the streets.
People of color have been dealing with injustice ever since they crossed the
North American continent. For instance, in West Baltimore, Ta-Nehisi was
trained not to go to the neighborhoods unless you know this place. He was
told that you cannot tolerate anybody attempting any physically violent threat
to you. Moreover, his mom was feared that her children would get arrested.
What does it mean? Undoubtedly, black Americans were afraid of police,
improper procedure, injustice or what is worse, being killed by police officer.
That's why the nationwide furor over the growing number of unarmed black
men fatally shot by police officers has put the public on a new trend in
America. In fact, this new trend caused disproportionate number of unarmed
people of color killed by police.

Tina Carter-Shileds has five kids and three of them recently started to drive.
The first thought she had when they wanted to drive alone was 'Wait a
minute. I'm really scared right now.' What should they do if they get pulled
over? What if they do something they don't supposed to be doing? It is not
always fair when officers arrest African Americans, but it's a reality. What if
police officers will automatically assume that your child is criminal because of
how him or her looks.
Black parents should remember that their kids will always be judged by the
way they look. That's why it's important to instruct our children how to react
when you are in trouble with law enforcement. Because if a stranger follows
your child after him/her buy a bag of Skittles, ran back into the store.

After eight years on the job, Margie Winters was fired as director of religious
education at Waldron Mercy Academy outside Philadelphia not because she
just married her wife, but because some parents just found out that she's
been married for all eight years.
Unfortunately LGBT teachers have long understood that openly expressing
their identity in school can make them an easy target for discrimination. It is
the biggest mistake!
When students perceive that they're not supposed to talk about
homosexuality, they conclude that there must be something wrong about
being gay. And it's a dangerous message that can lead to bullying and
harassment.
Gay teachers need to serve as example for kids! It's very powerful both for
straight students and for LGBT students to know that they have teachers and
people they respect who are LGBT and who are good at their jobs. It's
important for all students to see that nothing to be ashamed! And it must be
illegal for employers to discriminate against employees based on their actual
or perceived sexual orientation!",https://www.facebook.com/LGBT-United-839497472793277/,- Living In: United States,N/A,18 - 65+,N/A,"News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

634,"Most parents aren't prepared for the words, ""Mom, Dad. I'm gay."" For many
parents first reaction probably will be ""How will I ever handle this?"" The
answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help
to understand your child's sexuality and its meaning to you and your
continued relationship with your son or daughter.
Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their
child's sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as
problem-free - overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during
that time.
Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening - by rejecting what they're
hearing (""It's just a phase; you'll get over it""); by shutting down (""If you
choose that lifestyle, I don't want to hear about it""); or by not registering the
impact of what we're being told (""That's nice, dear, and what do you want
for dinner?"").
Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT children. If
you as a parent 'II pretend to forgot the truth about your child's sexuality, you
would never really know your child. A large part of his or her life would be kept
secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person.
It is important to accept and understand your child's sexuality because
homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment
for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of
telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through ""a phase"".
On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding
and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you're wondering, ""Is
she/he sure?"" the answer will almost always be ""yes""!
DON'T BE YOUR CHILD'S FIRST CLOSET!

A teenager shot by city police is paralyzed below the waist, his mother said
Sunday as her family copes with another episode of gun violence. Not seven
years ago, her teenage daughter was accidentally shot to death.
This time, a firearm in the hand of her son, Brandon Claxton, 16, prompted an
officer to shoot him three times about 7:15 p.m. Saturday in a housing
complex in the 2500 block of Hodiamont Avenue, officials said. Police
encountered him while responding to a call about someone with a stolen
pistol.
His mother said that she respected the police and that her son ""shouldn't
have had the gun."" But from what witnesses have told her, she said, ""They
didn't have to shoot him down like that.""
One of three witnesses interviewed Sunday told a reporter that Brandon did
have a gun in his hand. But all three said that he did not point a weapon at
anyone as he tried to run from officers.
When a white guy walks around with a rifle, nobody bats an eye. When a
black guy walks with a pistol (or even a toy gun)- he'll be immediately shot by
the police. Have you ever heard about open carry in the United States? Then

one candidate is complicit in fueling the war on drugs; another one in

A predominantly Melbourne black church was vandalized for the third time in
six months. According to the Melbourne Police Department, the vandal
bought axes to chop through access points to get in. Church Bishop
Jacquelyn Gordon said that the church was in the process of development
since they moved two years ago into 125,000 foot industrial complex.
Moreover, the message ""SS Charleston 2"" was found on the car nearby the
Church, which raised concerns about church security. SS Charleston 2

white supremacist Dylann Roof at Emanuel AME church. Before, the church
members found the words ""We see u"" that were painted in the radical emblem

The WWII veteran Johnnie H. Hodges refused to leave his house after he was
not able to pay his mortgage while caring for his sick wife. Police and
ambulance workers had to carry him away on a stretcher.
A 90-year-old Navy veteran lived in his Buffalo home with his wife for
decades. But about four years ago; he was taking care of his wife, who had
Alzheimer's disease and spent all his income on her rehabilitation. In the
process, he defaulted on his mortgage and amassed a huge debt totaling
$73;000 to M&T Bank. Unfortunately, due to his default on his mortgage loan
payments, he was evicted from his house on a stretcher.
Why does the U.S. government treat military veterans absolutely
disgracefully? Why the WWII veterans are literally being treated like human
garbage by their own government? How potentially disabled veteran was

""Do black females lives matter, too?""
That's the big question 16-year-old Amandla Stenberg posed on Instagram on
Sunday. The powerful post broke down the cultural double standards that
plague black women every day.
""Black features are beautiful, black women are not,"" Stenberg wrote. ""White
women are paragons of virtue and desire, black women are objects of
fetishism and brutality. This, at least, seems to be the mentality surrounding
black femininity and beauty in a society built upon eurocentric beauty
standards.""
Everybody knows that racism is alive and prospering in America. However, all
the news about killing black men and black teenagers, police brutality, unfair
sentences and other issues, distract us from the fact that black women are
being abused in the most violent ways. Usually they can't stand up for
themselves unlike men, so they endure and suffer.
In modern America black women experience more depression than probably
during slavery, when everything was obvious, but now racism is hidden
behind the mask of tolerance.",https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/,"United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;

black Police Chief, now exposing a racial rift
The leaders of small Maryland's city in Eastern Shore fired the Pocomoke
City's first black police Chief Kelvin Sewell due to his incompetence and
refusal to fire black police officers Franklin Savage and Lynell Green. Chief
Sewell was hired by Pocomoke City back in 2010 after his retirement from the
Baltimore Police Department. Earlier, before Sewell's dismissal he filed a
complaint on unequal employment opportunities claiming he was paid less
than his white predecessors.
This is circumstantial evidence that America is divided into different parts
based on race and income. Racism has gotten so bad, black people are
treated unfairly. If God created us equally, why the unequal treatment of
minorities still exists in our country? What if the firing gas stirred a new spirit

Last Saturday the 16-year-old Brandon Claxton prompted an officer to shoot

Recently Pentagon confirmed plan to lift ban on transgender military service.
Let's meet the big player in repealing the ban.
Sergeant Shane Ortega, 28, doesn't stand out or appear out of the ordinary
among his fellow Army soldiers.
But there's one thing that differs him from the bulk of troops. Shane is the first
openly trans soldier of the US Army.
He's astonishingly handsome, he works out constantly (check out his
muscular build), he covered in tattoos, he's part black, Latino and Cherokee,
he's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he
gets giddy talking about both video games and chopping wood in Alaska.
Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has
been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army
paperwork, he is identified as a woman.
But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for
the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded!
America's military progressing slowly towards inclusion and equal opportunity.
Let's hope that these changes'll ensure peace, instead of waging more war.

A man in Alabama collapsed and died after officers sprayed him with pepper
spray while arresting him after a chase, Tuscaloosa police said Saturday.
Police said Ware ran into nearby woods and struggled with officers when they
caught up with him. Officers sprayed him with oleoresin capsicum, more
commonly known as pepper spray, according to police. The chemical agent
debilitates a person by causing temporary blindness and irritating a person's
nose and throat.
The six officers who were involved in Ware's case will remain on duty during
an investigation, according to police. Officials said police car dash cam and
body camera footage of the incident would be released after that
investigation.
This tragedy happen accidentally, and probably the police officers didn't wish
death upon him, because they tried to give him first aid. However, the man is
dead and there is no chance to rewind and bring him back. He's gone forever,
but the cops will remain on duty and get away with this murder. Is this

Almost nothing except one thing... a man's life may be ruined because he had
the audacity to defend himself against huge man with malicious intent.

him. Do you have any idea what should police officer do in such situation? He
must stop the criminal, period. He was in a no-win situation and it proves how
upside-down society has become.
I wonder, what will be the next step of American justice degradation? Will
surgeons be fired for operate patients with knives? Will Supreme Court send

For years, inmates with non-violent felonies and misdemeanor charges in
New York City had to sit in Rikers Island for months awaiting trial, 'cause they
couldn't afford to pay bail.
Under the city's new bail initiative announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio last
week, some 3,000 low-level offenders are eligible for release without bail. The
system needs serious reform. According to the New York Police Department,
the biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or
disorderly conduct.
The New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit
with summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what
should we do?
The criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be changed. The worse, it
is now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep
people in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a
business.
The first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government
will start to sell indulgences soon.
Our system is not only unfair, but also corrupt! We should explore alternative
solutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and
potentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail!
Lemme ask you, have you ever seen a one of the tobacco industry executives
go to jail? I guess no. We also have never seen the Bush or any other
Presidents administrations were brought to justice.

died in jail cell in police custody last week. She was arrested for shoplifting

help.

check the cell every fifteen minutes but, no one checked Tumer's cell for
more than two hours.

custody in just the last month. Most of them were hold for minor charges and

Chapman from Alabama, Joyce Curnell from South Carolina, Ralkina Jones
from Ohio, and Raynetta Turner from New York were found dead in their cell

it is becoming dangerous.
So, a family from Moseley, Virginia was threatened at gunpoint for waving the
Confederate flag on their own private property on Monday night. While the
family was expressing their First Amendment right by waving the flag in their
own driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the
driveway, took out his gun, chambered a round, pointed it at the family.
""He slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me, he pulled out a
gun, chambered a round and told me my cause wasn't worth anything now,""
Mark Wilson said.
When one spits upon the law because he thinks that it's amoral, it is
beginning a chaos. Liberals want to ban a confederate flag because slavery
was in the 18th and 19th centuries. They don't want to understand that
slavery was legal in many countries of the world, but nobody wants to ban a
flag of England or France.
Activists and groups like the NAACP are also calling for statues and
monuments to Confederate leaders to be demolished, including the carving at
Stone Mountain, the largest bas relief sculpture in the world. Some are even
demanding that Washington, DC be renamed in the name of political
correctness because George Washington owned slaves.
Liberals actually want to destroy American history and culture. Americans
should be guided by the law, because sometimes moral is not clear. If
somebody thinks that the Democratic party is amoral, nobody demands to
eliminate the party.

Monday morning, July 20, the US flag continued to fly at the top of the White
House and the US capitol building despite the fact that a gunman killed five
US Marines in Chattanooga, Tenn. President Obama hasn't ordered to lower
a flag, though a federal law states that the flag shall be flown at half-staff upon
the deaths of principal figures or the governor can lower the US flag in his or
her state following the deaths of officials or members of the US Army. By
contrast, Obama ordered the flags to half-staff following on the same day that
as the shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The flag was lowered
to half-staff the day following the terrorist attack during the Boston marathon,
the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard and the following the death of
Nelson Mandela. But it hasn't yet been lowered in honor of the service
members murdered in Tennessee.
By doing so Obama shows the highest degree of disrespect for the fallen
soldiers. It turns out that for him the soldiers as well as veterans do not
deserve any attention or respect. Soldiers are needed only when it is
necessary to send them to the next unknown operation. They considered as
meat. But in reality, they are our heroes! They were victims of a terrorist
attack. They were victims of a man who at first won refugee status and then

attempt in Downtown Oakland Wednesday night. Is it a race war?
Yesterday night. a group of 50 protesters burned Confederate flag and tried to
shutdown a freeway in Downtown Oakland. The opposition to police violence
was in response to the police shooting earlier in the day.
According to Oakland Police Department, yesterday at 2:39 p.m. in the area
of 69th Avenue and International Boulevard. Oakland police officers spotted a
vehicle they believe to be connected to a previous robbery on July 27. The
pursuit started when the driver fled through Oakland streets until the suspect
crashed into another car in the area of 27th Avenue and Martin Luther King
Jr. street. But when the suspect ran of the car, three officers opened fire. The
suspect Joe Bart has died at the hospital.
Did you know that it was fifth shooting this year that involved police officers?
How quickly it has become so usual? Why it has become so legit? Where is
the government speaking about the existence of racism in America?

For decades, conservative Christians who oppose LGBT equality have
singled out the federal government or secular atheists as their preferred
enemy in public settings, blasting both groups for supposedly attacking
""traditional marriage"" or infringing on their religious liberty.
Yet in the months surrounding the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to
legalize same-sex marriage across the country, right-wing Christians have
become increasingly willing to cast blame — seemingly hypocritically — on a
group they have often dismissed or outright ignored: Progressive Christians,
especially those who support marriage equality.
I believe religions should teach love, they must stop teaching hatred! And

conservative Christians, they're not the ones screaming ""persecution"". They

A divided Ohio appeals court panel on Friday said it would not force a
municipal judge to issue arrest warrants for Cleveland police officers involved
in the fatal shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in a city park last November.
Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Ronald Adrine in June found probable
cause for Officer Timothy Loehmann, who shot Rice, and his partner, Frank
Garmback, to face charges in the shooting.
Loehmann shot Rice twice within seconds of arriving outside a city recreation
center on Nov. 22 in response to an emergency call of a man with a gun.
Rice, who was playing with an Airsoft-type replica handgun that shoots
pellets, died the next day.
By any means the justice system is trying to justify the cops, who should've
been never employed even. They shot the poor kid in 2 seconds after they
arrived, not even having time to understand the situation. Everyday police use
excessive force and weapons against unarmed people. Killers in uniform...

An unarmed black teenager in Texas was shot dead by a cop who had only
recently graduated from the police academy. Just over a week before his
death, he posted that he doesn't want to die too young on Twitter.
Officers responded to a burglary call around 1 a.m. on Friday, hearing reports
that a suspect was damaging vehicles. First spotting Taylor moving about the
lot, officers also noticed Taylor's SUV had been smashed into the front of the
dealership showroom. Finding that Taylor had moved inside the showroom,
Arlington Police Chief Police Will Johnson said Taylor would not comply when
told to lie down on the ground, but fled to a back room. 49-year-old officer
Brad Miller entered the showroom to arrest Taylor, and then an altercation
broke out. Miller fired four shots, including the fatal bullets from the gun of
Miller. A second officer fired a taser, Johnson said.
And now there are three main points that you should think of:
1) Taylor was described as a good kid. He was a football player at Angelo
State University. Never was involved in criminal activities.
2) The officer graduated from the police academy less than 6 months ago and
was working under the supervision of a training officer.
3) Taylor didn't want to die young.
Black teens don't really live, they survive. And, unfortunately, there is no one
to save them from death. There is no one to stop police brutality. We all want
our kids to feel safe, we want them to be safe and sound. Are our hopes

On Saturday there were two protests: a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina
and an anti-racism protest. About 2,000 people arrived to South Carolina's
statehouse. Some of them present the KKK's rally against the removal of the
Confederate flag, while others were from the New Black Panther party and
Black Lives matter groups, holding the Republic of New Afrika flag.
It is a very clear signal for the federal government that the protest obtains a
systematic and ideological basis. The Klan wanted to underline the traditional

biracial, being born to a white mother and a black father. But recently

about being pulled over for the phenomenon called ""driving while black"". For

This resolution will allow chartered organizations to select adult leaders

On Wednesday, Aug. 19 racial tensions again sparked in Missouri city after
St. Louis police officers fatally shot black teenager at Walton Avenue and

Police Chief San Dotson, a young black man pointed a gun at officers and
was trying to escape from a house where officers were carrying out a search
warrant for him. The 33-year-old and 20-year-old officers who shot the
suspect four times were about seven years on the force.
That was followed by crowd of 150 people who gathered by intersection. Later
on, nine people were arrested on charges of resisting arrest. The protesters
said that the police provoked the situation. What do you think about it? What if
this situation makes us want to keep the police out of our neighborhood? Why
do you think police shoots first and then asks questions? Do you realize that
the shooting came just ten days after St. Louis was flooded with protesters
who were marking the anniversary of Michael Brown? What if the city and the

him violently threatening teenagers because they were smiling at him and not
taking him seriously enough. Willis pulled them over because one of the
passengers allegedly flipped him the middle fighter from the window.
When one of the young men asks the officer ""What did I do?"" the officer
responds by saying, ""I don't know. I just don't like you, I just don't like you.""
The only crime committed by the occupants of the car was shooting the video.
We have a legal right to film and photograph police, in every state! People
should know their rights - it's the first step to stop police brutality.
If another person smiling makes you that upset, you should not be permitted
to own a gun. People, who have mental illness or anger issues should not
having access to guns. Guns should be in the hands of responsible adults!
Police went out of the control. How much respect do you think Police has for
people? 0! In this way, if you can't control yourself it's time to retire, you don't
deserve to carry the badge.
America needs better gun control. Although, it's not the type of gun that is the
problem. It is the type of gun owner that is the problem. America, control your
blue pigs!",https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/,"United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;

The Vatican has rejected a request by a transgender man in Spain to become
a godparent, ruling that his sexual identity means he is incapable of carrying
out the task.
Alex Salinas was asked by his family to be godfather to his nephew, but the
bishop of his local diocese on Spain's southern coast questioned his gender
identity.
Salinas was born a woman but has since undergone hormone therapy and
has a male ID in Spain. He is now waiting for gender surgery.
Bishop Rafael Zornoza Boy of Cadiz and Ceuta rejected the family's request
to name Salinas as a godfather. Then, after a media storm, the bishop wrote
to the Vatican for advice.
Zornoza published the Vatican's reasoning for rejecting Salinas' wish.
It said transsexual behavior ""reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to
the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the
truth of one's own sexuality.""
The pope supported gays, but now for some reason the transman wasn't
allowed to be a godfather in Spain, an entirely Catholic, but at the same time,

561,"SCOTUS RULES AGAINST KENTUCKY CLERK IN GAY MARRIAGE CASE
The Supreme Court on Monday evening denied a Kentucky clerk's request to
keep enforcing her ""no marriage licenses"" policy — an attempt to avoid
issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples — while she appeals the trial
court's preliminary ruling.
Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis will have to choose whether to issue marriage
licenses, defying her Christian conviction, or continue to refuse them, defying
a federal judge who could pummel her with fines or order that she be hauled
off to jail.
For Ms. Davis to enact her own personal policy is completely unacceptable.
She is on her fourth marriage, a sinner according to her Bible, yet she's
screaming about religious convictions. What a hypocrite!
And she doesn't even perform the ceremony, only issue a license. What her
religious convictions has to do with it?? It's not up to her to make policy, it's
her role only to enact it!
Funny how all these ""Christians"" are preaching and practicing all this hate,
eh?
If Jesus were around today, his response would be most likely, ""What the hell
is wrong with you people!""

With Crutches in San Francisco
Writer Chaedria LaBouvier reported that she had seen 14 San Francisco
police officers subduing a homeless black man who had one leg outside
Twitter headquarters.
Witnesses told LaBouvier that police had been called because the man was
waving sticks,"" which later turned out to be his crutches.
None of the employees at Twitter or other tech companies came out to object
as the 14 officers took down the one-legged homeless man.
The U.S. Justice Department recently filed court documents in an Idaho case
which declared it unconstitutional to criminalize homelessness. According to
the Coalition on Homelessness, the city handed out 11,000 citations to
homeless people who were sitting on sidewalks between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m.
in 2014.
What kind of people police usually hire? Mentally unstable bloodthirsty
cowards or? We already know the answer. Sometimes we all wonder do
police officers have mercy for anyone? Hard to say, because what we see
confuses us.",https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/,"- Living In: United States: Baltimore Maryland: Ferguson, St. Louis
