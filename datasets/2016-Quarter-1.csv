"905","There're a lot of racial discrimination going on in America these days. Can
you imagine that a group of armed men took over a federal property and have
vowed to kill if they are forced to leave there unless the government change
the law in their favor. Nonsense!
The ongoing Oregon standoff has taught us is that it's never been more
apparent that the U.S. government values white lives above all others. The
most stark example is comparing the kid-gloves treatment the white gunmen
in Oregon are getting with the 1985 bombing of the MOVE house in
Philadelphia.

"897","Robert Bentley, Alabama Governor, has decided to reform prison system.
This is actually good news? Alabama happens to be one of the nation's
poorest states which have led to overcrowd in its prison. The prison system
houses 24,000 inmates but it was designed for 13,000.Let me enlighten you a
little on how it's going to be done. Four other larger prisons will be built
additionally to prevent the rate of overcrowd. Even though one would have
taught of using this money for projects like health care facilities and other, he
chose prisons. It's not bad though, at least inmates will have free live behind
bars. It shows how much he cares for his people.

"841","A young black guy who was mentally disabled decided to end his life, but will
only do that by making the cops kill him. This is absolutely insane in the
highest order. He took a gun and ordered his other two brothers to take a
video of the whole incident. Michael Ford, at the police vicinity opened fire
and got the cop's attention. The filming was still in process as he
commanded. The first cops who appeared fired back and almost immediately
ended up drawing fire. He gave the other officer a chance to get into position
when he opened fire. It's quite not understandable why his own cop shot him
and shot the mentality ill man too. This is a good example of sick reality too. Is
there any explanation why cops have started shooting each other?

Through the struggles and pains of losing a dear husband. Nicole Bennett has
built courage to take maternity photos with her 4-year-old son. She added old
photos of late husband Deonta, but they were slightly faded to appear as a
spirit — a symbol of hope that he watches over them.
She also did this as a memorial for her unborn daughter who is due March 25.
We commend her for her boldness and we hope that she finds solace in these
photos.

pro-immigration policy. She also promised to offer illegals residency and ""a
path of citizenship"". During the debate on 8th March she was asked about
deportation.
Clinton said: ""I would not deport children. I do not want to deport family
members either. I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent
criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us. That's
a relatively small universe."" Oh wonderful, so she admits she wants to be the
second Obama, like the first one isn't enough. And we know what's behind
this world ""children"" — young men who claim to be less than 18. Same way
the ""illegals without a criminal record"" is also those who are not proved to be
criminals yet.
Crossing the U.S. border without permission is already a crime. A crime that
should bring just one simple punishment — deportation and a prohibition of
further entrance. We do not need a president who doesn't understand that.

named Upendo Children Centre. The main aim of this orphanage was to

stayed. He also based his choice on being in a better position to assist the
children should the need arise. Mathew raped three teenagers — ages of 5, 9,

"540","This Monday Clinton had a public interview event where she was asked to tell
about Iraq war and Intervention in Libya during her being as a secretary of
state. After attacks in Benghazi, after her actions and lies caused a national
scandal, after officially being caught on lies she afforded herself to make a
statement ""I've said Iraq was a mistake. Libya was a different kind of
calculation. And we didn't lose a single person.""
More than three years passed after the accident and still Clinton didn't even
contact Benghazi victims' families. She didn't even try to ask for excuse, like
those murdered Americans don't even exist. We definitely don't need a
President who lies without a twinge of conscience. Luckily most Americans
won't trust such an obvious liar.","https://www.facebook.com/patriototus/","- Living In: United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

a former Black Panther passed away Nebraska prison.
In 1970, Rice was one of the two officers who were charged for the murder of
Omaha police officer, Larry Minard. Authorities claim they coaxed Larry to a
house with a 911 call, and then detonated a homemade bomb that killed him.
He was the seventh-longest-serving inmate in Nebraska.
Subsequent paroles and retrials were denied for these two men. Langa was in
prison for 45 years. Details of the cause of his death are still unknown.

"826","It is so disheartening knowing that people are put behind bars because they
failed to settle a fine. Most people are jailed because one way or the other
there was no money to do what was necessary at a particular time even
though they were innocent. Prosecutors have developed this platform as a
gold mine, extracting huge sum of money from civilians. You can be put
behind bars if you fail to comply with the demands. Suddenly one's life
becomes tattered when jail comes in, because there is no freedom of making
a better living. Federal prosecutors should shake up and hold judges and all
these people who take advantages of people by making them pay huge sums
of money or put someone behind bars because he/she couldn't pay a fine.

"1327","Congressional Republicans voted on Thursday to make it more difficult for
refugees from Syria and Iraq to come to the US as the fallout from last
Friday's Isis terrorist attacks in Paris continues.
In addition, more than half of the US's governors have said they will no
longer provide placement for Syrian refugees, arguing that they pose too
great a risk to national security.
New Jersey governor and Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie
has said his state will not take in any refugees — ""not even orphans under the
age of five"".
Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal has said he has directed state police to
""track"" the Syrian refugees in his state, something his state police have
played down.
GOP presidential hopefuls Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush have suggested the US
government prioritize Christian refugees.
Barack Obama has pledged to veto the legislation, and has condemned the
anti-refugee comments as ""un-American"", but experts worry the backlash
could have dangerous consequences if these claims go unchecked.

seeking,"" said lain Levine, deputy executive director for program at Human

they also need to stand with people uprooted from their homes by ideologies

"782","Brendan Carter decided to pay a visit to his sick uncle and was held by
officers in a public RTS bus station in Rochester, New York. Carter said he
was at a station waiting for bus. Freeing himself from emotional trauma,
Carter decided to hip his soul with music, when he put his headphones on
and started to dance. Suddenly, officers approached him and began asking
him out of the premises. Apparently he had not committed any crime or
violated any order, so he was disturbed and begun to argue with them.
Seriously this guy was detained for useless reasons. This is what American
police find interest in — unnecessary and useless way of harassing blacks.
Very ridiculous.

"537","The liberal mass media tried to overblow a story about the KKK's
endorsement of Trump. They claimed Donald is supported by David Duke and
""white supremacists"". The journalists are trying to depict Trump as a racist
and continue their attempts even after Trump officially declared ""I don't know
anything about David Duke... You're asking me a question that I'm supposed
to be talking people I know nothing about.""
However, ""for some reasons"" the same mass media in their revelation
campaign forgot to mention Hillary Clinton's ties to Robert Byrd, a former
KKK leader. Hillary described him as a man of ""surpassing eloquence and
nobility"". In 2010 after Byrd died she released a tribute video saying ""It is
almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd.
He was not just its longest-serving member; he was its heart, its soul, and its
historian. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he
was always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless
advocacy for his West Virginia constituents, his fierce defense of the
Constitution, and the traditions of the Senate, and his passion for a
government that improves the lives of the people it serves.""
So here the mass media give us an political paradox: a Republican candidate
can't be endorsed by a former KKK member, but a Democrat can easily show
her respect and honor to a former racist leader without being judged for that.

this Thursday broadcast on Fox Business Network. She said there is ""a

Smith added in her interview: ""I want Hillary to talk to me personally, and tell
me why there was no security there, when they were asked for it. I know this,
because I spoke to my son. That day, he says he was really scared, because
he saw the 17 people — 17 November, whatever it was, that they were walking
around taking pictures. And he was afraid. He says it didn't look very good.
And he was afraid. And that he asked for security, and he was turned down.""
This must be a mean joke we're having that kind of liar as a possible
president. Even understanding that most liberals are brainwashed I just don't
get it - how can a politician caught in a lie of that scale still be trusted by

Dear Mrs. Clinton,
We are trying not to be political, but the current presidential elections and the
rise of hate against Muslims made us realize that it is time to stand and let our
voices be heard.
We know that you defend American Muslims now in your presidential
campaign, but did you support us before campaign?
We didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq, we are Muslims and
Americans, so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused
hundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their
homes, and also millions of Iraqi Muslims, including innocent men, women
and children, to die in their homes, and for what?
Libya! You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill AI-
Gaddafi. You said in an interview: ""We came, we saw, he died"". Let's not
forget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security,
and that caused the death of the U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens
and U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and
CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were
also injured in the attacks.
You killed Saddam Hussein and AI-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the
countries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat
not only to the U.S. but the whole world!
You are supporting gun control, disarming the American citizens and at the
same time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders,
creating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq,
Afghanistan and Syria.
8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years
ago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it. You change
your views very fast. You speak as a democrat and act as a republican. Sorry,
but you can not be our representer, you can not be the president of the United
States.
Sincerely,
United Muslims of America","https://www.facebook.com/MuslimAmerica/","United States

highest order. He took a gun and ordered his other two brothers to take a
video of the whole incident. Michael Ford, at the police vicinity opened fire
and got the cop's attention. The filming was still in process as he
commanded. The first cops who appeared fired back and almost immediately
ended up drawing fire. He gave the other officer a chance to get into position
when he opened fire. It's quite not understandable why his own cop shot him
and shot the mentality ill man too. This is a good example of sick reality too. Is
there any explanation why cops have started shooting each other?

"1610","Religious leaders joined local organizations in rallying support for two men
who said they were attacked outside a convenience store this weekend in
what police are investigating as a possible hate crime.
Authorities are reviewing surveillance video of the reported attack, which
occurred shortly after 3 a.m. Saturday at the Kwik Shop at 4820 E. 21 st St.
That's just northeast of the Wichita State University campus.
One of the victims was Khondonkor Usama, Muslim 23, the second victim, is
a 19-year-old student who has chosen to remain anonymous.
They were getting gas and snacks at about 3 a.m. Saturday when they
noticed a man shouting at someone who had apparently asked him for gas
money.
When the suspect began using racial slurs against the man who asked him
for money, one of the students attempted to intervene.
The attacker then turned his wrath on the two students, stopping his
motorcycle in front of Usama's car and approaching Usama's friend, who
had gotten out of the car.
The suspect called his friend ""brown trash"" and told him he had to ""leave this
country,""
According to Usama's account, his friend responded: ""This is my country.
Who the hell are you to tell me to leave?""
The incident ""escalated really quick,"" with the suspect attempting to punch
his friend, Usama said. When he attempted to break up the fight, Usama said
he was assaulted and knocked down.
He called 911, and as he was on the phone the attacker rode circles around
the two students, chanting ""Trump! Trump! Trump!"" and screaming, ""We'll
make America great again! We'll throw you out of the wall!""","https://www.facebook.com/MuslimAmerica/","- Living In: United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

is well-known how libtards are eager to blame our forefathers for being racist.
Yet they always forget to underpin their empty words with facts. Not like all
these SJWs, let's refer to racial discrimination in the army of Union. A black
soldier was paid $10 a month with a $3 clothing fee taken out, while a white
soldier was paid $13 a month but was not forced to pay a clothing allowance.
Almost a twofold difference! How tolerant tho! And what was going on in the
""racist"" Confederate States Army? Every soldier was paid $11/month until
1864 regardless of his skin color. Click to Learn More! #southunited South

"838","Police Officer Robert Rialmo's attorney, Joel Brodsky, says that he will be
filing a counterclaim against the estate of Quintonio LeGrier on the grounds of
assault and emotional distress. This is how it looks like when A White Police
kills a black Civiliian, and also feels it's his right to sue the dead because
sympathizers gave him a sleepless night. If it was lawful to kill Quintonio
LeGrier because he was in abnormal state of mind according to the cops,
then we ask, how about the shooting of Bettie Jones? The story is always
rewritten and painted when it comes to dealing with race. Racial disparity and
segregation cannot be overlooked in America. There is too much level of
inhumanity. The cops still things it wasn't enough killing a mentally
disordered and an innocent woman. He still has the balls to sue even the
dead. This is what living in America is like, if you are black.","https://www.facebook.comnWiiIIiamsandKalvin/","United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile
