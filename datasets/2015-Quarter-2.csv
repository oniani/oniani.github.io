"330","American Racists On The Road
The racists group of America ""Back To The Blue"" are organizing a hate rally
in response to the public outcry and protests against police officers.
""Bikers-patriots"" want to descend on the McKinney Police HQ in a show of
solidarity for the police because race-baiters and cop-haters. They plan to
have ""the biggest thing to happen in Patriot Movement since the Bundy
Ranch victory!""
It seems like we won't get into ""post-racial America"".... this event and the
regular murder of innocent Black children by white supremacist police and
citizens makes that clear. The modern government has brought racist
America to the forefront, good or bad. This is something that America has a
serious issue with - RACISM!

"343","The violent pool story #3. White police officer slammed black teen against his
car
This black family from Ohio will never forget the June 9th. According to the
family's testimony, Krystal Dixon and her sister Maya Dixon took their eight
children, nephews and nieces to Ohio public school in a Fairfield.
Nevertheless, the pool employee demanded the family to leave due to one of
the children did not have swim trunks. One of the boys broke the rules and
the staff asked the family to leave. As six-months pregnant Krystal Dixon
walked to the parking lot, the police officer grabbed her arm and asked for an
ID-card. The witness video shows how the police officer pepper sprayed
Dixon's family and grabbed 12-year-old child by neck. But according to the
Fairfield police department, the white police officer did not use excessive
force.
Did the pool staff force them to leave because they were black? Was it a race
factor? Don't you think the police officer's attempt to arrest Krystal Dixon was
unlawful? How the police officers should be charged? What kind of right of
defense do you have against unlawful arrests?
These days, there is far more to being a ""good cop"" than choosing not to hurt
innocent people. Plus, when are we going to stop being stereotypical? Even
today, the stereotypes effect black population of the United States of America
transmitted through music, lyrics, titles, literature, movies and folk saying.
White Americans across the country embrace African-Americans the image of
criminals and looters. How are we going to live with that?","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;

"429","Sadness and shocking tragedy at historically black church in Charlestone
A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other church members at black
church in Charlestone, S.0 on Wednesday night. The young clean-shaved
shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people.
Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be
investigated as hate crime.
Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American church which was
found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822.
Despite the first black American president, Africa-Americans remain the most
common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to
xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage
that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms
take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we
think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for
Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last
February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from
the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate
and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-crimes?
What if American racial change still occurs through generations? What of it
racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a
deeply racist country? What if the church is not a safe place anymore?","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;

A Texas fourth-grade teacher Karen Fitzgibbons published a racial Facebook
post in which she confirmed that Black people are responsible for racial
tensions in the USA. Moreover she claimed that she is ""almost to the point""
of defending the segregation. After her post about the recent pool party
incident drew local attention, the teacher deleted her profile.
""This makes me ANGRY! This officer should not have had to resign. I'm
going to just go ahead and say it....the blacks are the ones causing the
problems and this `racial tension. I guess that's what happens when you
flunk out of school and have no education. I'm sure their parents are just as
guilty for not knowing what their kids were doing; or knew it and didn't care,""
she wrote. She also added,""I'm almost to the point of wanting them all
segregated on one side of town so they can hurt each other and leave the
innocent people alone. Maybe the 50s and 60s were really on to something.

As we see Karen Fitzgibbons is a real racist, who approves the humiliation of
black people! This news clearly reflects that American society is close to
collapse, if not to say to war. As the authorities are doing nothing to resolve
the situation, in the near future we may face real race war within our country.","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;

"654","NOM'S LAST ATTEMPT TO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE
National Organization for Marriage is asking all of the GOP presidential
candidates to sign an anti-equality pledge. Let's take a look at just how crazy
this pledge gets.
That's just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional
amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last
decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55
percent!
But they don't stop there. NOM also wants candidates to ""work to overturn
any Supreme Court decision"" in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants
the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at
this point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that
supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn't qualified to be a judge.
Also, NOM wants the candidates to weaken civil rights laws, creating
loopholes to let companies and citizens to discriminate if they cite a religious
justification. That could actually happen — and it already has in some states —
so it's a huge concern.
And fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment
against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are
harassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated
from their families, but I really hope soon there'll be NO MORE of it!
There's a part of me that feels very sad for NOM's fanatics. When they
finally kick the bucket, they'll be dealing with the reality (whether they openly
face it or not) that their Life's Work has amounted to NOTHING. Nothing they
worked for made anyone's life better. At all.
They didn't win, and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable.
And when they're dead and gone, they'll be remembered only as footnotes
in shameful history — or more likely they'll be forgotten completely.

Ruby Rose has long been the celebrity crush of lesbians the world over. But
now that she's a star in 'Orange is the New Black', the popularity of this
model, actress, and VJ has grown worldwide.
""Gender fluidity is not really feeling like you're at one end of the spectrum or
the other. For the most part, I definitely don't identify as any gender,"" - Rose
said; - ""I'm not a guy; I don't really feel like a woman, but obviously I was born
one. As a little kid, I was convinced that I was a guy. Then in my teens, I tried
to be quite feminine...And after a little bit, chopped everything off and am kind
of back where I started. So, I'm somewhere in the middle, which - in my
perfect imagination - is like having the best of both sexes.""

stop gun-related violence, like the Wednesday massacre at Emmanuel

It's strange to hear it from the man who supported 2nd amendment earlier.
The lack of clear-cut opinion is very bad character trait. However, it doesn't
matter.
The right to bear arms is inalienable right of Americans that was given us by
the Founding Fathers. The 2nd amendment guarantees private safety of the
people. The right to keep and bear arms has been recognized as existing
prior even to the creation of a written national constitution. The govermmnet
should respect the 2nd amendment and the law in general. It's pity when
some politicians think otherwise.
People should understand that a gun is not a killing tool, it's self-defense tool.

Transgender teen Mercedes Williamson was found dead in a wooded area.
She is the ninth confirmed transgender homicide victim in the USA this year.
Police in George County. Mississippi have charged a suspect Josh Brandon
Vallum. Police said that Mercedes and Josh knew each other, but it is not
clear if Vallum knew Williamson was a transgender. Jeanie Miller, whom
Williamson had been living with, said that Vallum knew that Williamson was
transgender.
Modern America is too dangerous for transgenders. This is the ninth
transgender killing based on gender identity. According to the National
Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs' report hate-motivated violence against
transgenders rose 13%. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to live as a
transgender in the South. Alabama even passed a religious freedom law in
1998 that allows discrimination against LGBT people. That also allows
lawmakers to justify hostility toward transgender people. And that we call
`freedom'? America is no longer land of freedom!","https://www.facebook.com/LGBT-United-839497472793277/","- Living In: United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

Cleve Jones, a human rights activist, who was mentored by Harvey Milk.
It is proposed that the class will begin in autumn. Really perfect idea! There
are at least twenty eight percent of LGBT students in Asawa High School. It is
the fact that we need such classes in every American school! Children
shouldn't be afraid to show who they are; they shouldn't be afraid to speak
about LGBT history; they should know that it is normal to be gay or lesbian or
transgender. Everybody should be taught to understand LGBT people and
recognize them as ordinary citizens.","https://www.facebook.com/LGBT-United-839497472793277/","- Living In: United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

But Obama's administration is tied to the chariot of immigrants. Democrats
know that immigrants will vote for the Democratic party. Especially former

illegals as soon as possible. It will allow to increase a number of votes for a

to death
Today, the pool party in Georgia is even more shocking than a recent pool
party in Texas. A young man from Georgia was shot to death at a pool party
at Fayette. It was an advertised on social 200 teenager's pool party which
ended up with shootings of unknown assailant for unknown reasons. One of
the five injured, a 19-year-old black teenager Clanton passed away on the
way to hospital.
In fact, the media has not made a transparent effort to cover up the incident.
Why the pool party in Georgia is a silent story? Why the police was not aware
of a large party? Why this story has no national outrage? Is it ok when a black
teenager dies?
Unfortunately, the responding police officers were not able to prevent the
tragedy. From these facts one might conclude, police officers know the
easiest ways to arrest people, but they are irresponsible to avoid the
shootings at the average pool party.","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;

What is the most important thing the government must to do this year in order
our country to live in peace?
The criminal justice system is very important institution where law
enforcement investigate a crime gathering evidences to identify the presumed
perpetrator ensuring that rights of the convicted are respected. But what if
American criminal justice reform outdated and the country need to focus on a
renewed sense of justice? What if disproportionate punishment is the main
challenge of the criminal justice system?
Disproportionate punishments known far and wide across the United States of
America. Consequently, the victim's skin color plays a crucial role in deciding
what kind of punishment he will receive. For instance, you are more likely to
be sentenced to death if you have killed a white person. Frankly speaking, if
the government wants to keep the country away from the summer urban riots,
then they must think about the living standards of black population that is
several times below the living standards of white people in America. In
addition, the White House must reduce the unemployment rates of black
population by revising the hiring policy for black Americans.Therefore, if we
want a life's balance, the government have to reconsider all these things,
because Black Americans lives matter.","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;

Niggerized Black President""
Reacting to President Obama's use of the n-word on Marc Maron's podcast,
Cornel West called him the first ""niggerized"" president in an appearance on
CNN. West criticized Obama as ""a person who is afraid and intimidated when
it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy.""
""A niggerized black person is a black person who is afraid and scared and
intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy and
fighting against white supremacy,"" West explained. ""So when many of us said
we have to fight against racism, what were we told?'No, he can't deal with
racism because he has other issues, political calculations. He's the president
of all America, not just black America.' We know he's president of all America
but white supremacy is American as cherry pie.""
West is right as usual. African minorities would choose Mr. West in 2009 and
2012 instead of Obama. But we had no choice. Cornel is a good leader, he
knows what black community is suffering from. Obama was promoted by big
corporations owned by white people. Obama never tried to protect blacks
from police pressure, never tried to stop police violence against blacks. Just
count how many black lives were destroyed during his presidency. The

records, just for making money. American society at all levels became too
corruptive, starting from our government and ending with ordinary citizens. On
the contrary Tupac did his music to influence the world. That's why he spoke
to issues of poverty, oppression and racism.
Today young African-Americans have fallen under bad influence of money,
drugs and so on. Yeah, it is all started from the government's attitude
towards Blacks. But let's remember Tupac and his ability to question the
social order. Changes, one of his popular songs, asks everyone to change
their lifestyles for better society. He always asked people to share with each
other and to learn to love each other.","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;

fraud. Simply she was given a task to join the association of black community

The autopsy report suggested that Gray may have attempted to stand up
during the van ride, and that the injury could have occurred as he was thrown
against the van wall when the vehicle changed direction. Like really? When
police took Gray to the hospital, doctors determined that he had sustained a
severed spine and crushed voice box. High-energy injury? We don't think so.
It's hard to believe. Do they think we're idiots or something?
Cops imprison you, shoot you, sever your spine, crush your larynx, send you
to war, keep you poor, call you a thug and get away with it. There's no excuse
for what happened to Freddie.","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;

Not many of you will probably be able to recognize Ella Baker, who was a
hero of the civil rights Freedom Movement, racial and economic injustice for
five decades. Her job was to put together the pieces in order to create a
strong organization in the face of racism and injustice. She played a key role
in NAACP; Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Martin Luther

"341","Sadness and shocking tragedy at historically black church in Charlestone
*CLICK TO GET LIVE UPDATES ON OUR PAGE*
A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other church members at black
church in Charlestone, S.0 on Wednesday night. The young clean-shaved
shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people.
Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be
investigated as hate crime.
Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American church which was
found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822.
Despite the first black American president, Africa-Americans remain the most
common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to
xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage
that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms
take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we
think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for
Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last
February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from
the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate
and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-crimes?
What if American racial change still occurs through generations? What of it
racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a
deeply racist country? What if the church is not a safe place anymore?

There is quite a big number of people arguing about ethnicity of Jesus Christ.
Was Jesus white, olive-skinned or black? The Coptic Museum in Cairo, Egypt
owns the earliest painting of Jesus Christ in the Church of Rome (6th century)
where skin color of Jesus was black.","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;
