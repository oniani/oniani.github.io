altercation with a student.
According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim,
Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom.
The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a
brief clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him.
I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more
then a bunch of bullies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever
happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an
officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide

of France, larger than the defense budgets of the United Kingdom, Germany,
and Japan, and only $12 billion less than the entire Russian military budget of
2015. But what about domestic and State Department spending? For
example, such an increase for the Department of Defense means 31% cut in
the EPA's budget and a 29% cut in the State Department. In other words, it's
a great number of opportunities squandered in favor of the interests of high-
powerful warmongers in our government. Environment, diplomacy, alternative

After all, it was Trump who promised to put America First and promised to end
Obama's policy of wasting budget money on military operations overseas.
""We're not going into Syria"", Trump said it to calm down those who got really
concerned about a possibility of America getting involved into another war.
really want to trust these words, but unfortunately many high-ranked
politicians want to force Trump to pull America into another war.
Here's what Ron Paul thinks about it: ""By the end of this month, Defense
Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will
deliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan,
Iraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send
his national security team back to the drawing board — or replace them. There
is no way another ""surge"" in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria)
puts America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will
succeed any better than it did the last time.""
Syria will be just another oil war; Iraq cost our country 4,500 soldier lives, and
why the hell are we still in Afghanistan? We've started the whole Afghanistan
thing to beat the Soviets, and no there's no Soviet Union on the world map,

On April 14 the Plummers' door had been kicked in by burglars.
On April 16 Plummer, his mother, and his 14-year-old little brother did not see
the police lights because the unit was parked down the road.
Plummer called 911 to report the burglars and then grabbed his
Grandfather's shotgun that was given to his mother for protection.
When Plummer went to the door, the scared kid fired a warning shot to fend
off the would-be burglars.
However, the shotgun blast hit one officer in the arm and the other in the face.

drawing our country into another regime change venture. Our military

there to fight and die for Globalists, Saudis and Israelis, but not for
Americans. And that's why we keep on talking about it: this policy is directly
opposite to the ""America First"" concept.
I believe Trump can fix it, just like he promised. Sadly days after days and
weeks after weeks of Trump's presidency there are no changes in that
direction. Israel captured a Syrian region named Golan Heights in 1967, and
today this land is internationally considered to be occupied territory. Israelis
want to use Trump's influence so the world would acknowledge Israeli
sovereignty. Trump is a dealer, and maybe he's trying make a deal out of it,
but there's one important thing here: under no circumstances can our
soldiers' lives be put at risk for that. So many times during the presidential
campaign Trump said ""let's bring back our soldiers home"", and now it's

killing innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common
that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were
wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,
karma's coming back for blue pigs!
A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police
officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two
officers for seemingly no reason.
The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two
school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza
shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of
police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally
nothing without using their guns.
Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their
own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and
electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing their job."" All those things and
more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my
rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.
Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine
about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is
why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our
ancestors did it for centuries.

will end now when Trump is in charge.
A new Marine Corps artillery unit was sent to assist Syrian opposition in
Raqqa, according to Army Maj. Josh T. Jacques, a spokesman for U.S.

the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which provided artillery support to Kurdish
and Syrian Arab forces expected to launch an offensive against Raqqa.
We must deal with ISIS and end the terrorist threat once and for all.
Unfortunately that's hardly possible because of the corruption in the

McCain, and that's why our troops not only focus on defeating terrorism, but
also getting involved into another regime change venture and possibly
another oil war.
We're fighting radical Islamists, but we're also siding with Syrian opposition,
the very same radical Islamists, and there's absolutely no guarantee that
these rebels won't replace ISIS when it's gone.
