Of course, many of you will scoff at comparing 49ers quarterback Colin
Kaepernick to Martin Luther King Jr., who also demanded better from America
in 1966. But after all, Kaepernick is a great athlete who not just sat out the
national anthem in protest, but also gave back to the community by donating
to the Black Youth Project 100.
Kaepernick donated to the Chicago chapter of the organization toward
""Chapter-specific ideas and endeavors centered on advancing Agenda to
Build Black Futures"" which is dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all
Black people in order to improve the lives of black people in the United States
of America.
""I'll continue to look at other communities in Chicago, as well, as far as what
are ways I can help and what are ways I can try to help empower those
communities,"" he said.
When someone strives to uplift the negativity surrounding black people, there
is always someone who will distort the positivity. But we don't really care
about haters.

Protest to Stop Police Brutality, Repression and the Criminalization of a
Generation.
Here in Charlotte, this problem appears especially hard. A number of victims
and quantity of cases, where justice wasn't served - horrifies. The most well-
known case is shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed black man who was
shot ten times and killed. Or situation with Daniel Kevin Harris, a deaf man,
who just couldn't explain a thing, before he was shot.

representatives, to do, the thing they are supposed to do! To protect and
serve! Not to kill, damage and cripple!

"2790","HILLARY CLINTON CHEATS AMERICAN VETERANS
The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans' issues was
in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans' life
improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are
some real Clinton decisions:
—Last year, Clinton claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had
been exaggerated by Republicans.
—In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007
supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans'
medical care.
-In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20
million for veterans' health care facilities.
-In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for 113 billion
for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.""
In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the
poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the
issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they
need so bad!
Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a
direct threat to the American veterans' society, but still practically no one
raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!","https://www.facebook.comNeterans-Come-First-1757336424535312/","- Living In: United States

A recent study has revealed some surprising differences in credit scores
between African-Americans and Caucasians.
The study showed that Caucasians earning less than $25,000 per year were
likely to have better credit scores than African-Americans earning between
$65,000 and $75,000 per year.
Overall, the study found 27 percent of all credit reports belonging to
Caucasians were poor, compared to 48 percent of those belonging to African-
Americans.
Although credit reporting is supposed to be free of prejudice, some
researchers said the system may be inherently stacked against minorities.

spent his public career working toward ending segregation and fighting racial

By recalling King's vision we can have opportunities to build a more inclusive

from it. In the face of violence directed at minority communities and in a
deepening political divisions in the country, King's words and philosophy are
perhaps more critical for us today than at any point in the recent past.

STRUGGLED WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER
Michelle Lee Shirley was fatally shot by Torrance police officer as she
approached a group of police officers in her car.
Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were
warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley,
who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars.
When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at
her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting.
After the shooting, Shirley was taken to County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center
and was pronounced dead.
Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to
balance motherhood and law school. In a video titled, ""It's Up to Us,"" she
was asking people to take seriously a mental disorder and seek help because
ignoring it can take away years of people's lives.
Did you know that people with mental illness are 16 times more likely to be
killed during a police encounter than mental healthy? Did you know that half
of people shot by cops are mentally ill?
Police officers are not equipped with firearms to deal with mental illness in the
field. But they are equipped to protect us from criminals.","https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/","United States

He said to them,""But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if
you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.""
— Luke 22:36
What does that mean? Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But
enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always
was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be
followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need
of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would
be exposed to, and of their need of protection.
And we, American Christians, should remember about it. Sometimes you
have to arm yourself to protect your loved ones and friends.","https://www.facebook.com/Army-of-Jesus-1195795607160174/","- Living In: United States

people take the easy and passive-aggressive way out and just leave notes

"3157","Joshua was born in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in Indianapolis. Two months
before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two
sons.
Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of
his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in
Indianapolis at the age of 26.
Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what
authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off-
duty firefighter.
The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest
Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said.
Suddenly, Boxley said, a car cut her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old
sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her
off — who she believed was a Chicago police officer — stopped and got out of
their cars.
At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a
gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley.
She said the man got inside his car but exited again and ""he just started
shooting,"" hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his
gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal
legally owned the gun and did not fire it.
Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began
shooting him.
""I was hoping my brother wasn't dead,"" said Boxley.
Beal's mother said he was a father to two children, a 4-year-old and a 2-year-
old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother.
""This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They
have no consideration for life,"" - Tiffaney Boxley.
Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will
say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own
death, armed or unarmed.

If you exclusively date outside of your ethnicity and culture, you hate yourself.
Don't talk to me until you start to love yourself.
I'm going to get many people complaining about this post... I don't care. If you
won't check for your own people, seek help not more approval.
I'm not saying you should ever check for people outside of your culture, I am
saying brothers if every women you have ever been with, isn't from your
culture/ethnic group, you have issues of the mind. You are doing this not by
love but on purpose, because you hate yourself subconsciously, it's ok, just
love yourself and heal your illness. ?

"725","Fellow Texans! It's time to say a strong NO to the establishment robbers. It is
unacceptable for us to see them ruin all we've been building for decades. For
centuries. The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but
they are wrong. We won't put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does
not talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it
mention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some
outdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a
victory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no.
We are free citizens of Texas and we've had enough of this cheap show on
the screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and
gun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but
not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher
taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist
attacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let's remind them
what Texas is made of and show that we're ready to SECEDE!
Use our page to team up with other locals. Invite your friends and family,
spread the word and let's make this effort together! Get Ready to Secede!","https://www.facebook.com/events/1828560880690663/","- Living In: United States: Abilene (+30 mi), Amarillo (+30 mi), Austin

downtown Charleston.
Joseph, a retired Pittsburgh firefighter, is moving an old house on Woolfe
Street that's being displaced by development says he's doing it to make a
statement.
""It was something that I really wanted to go into because it was something
that's not done here by black folk. said Joseph Wicks; who now owns the
house at 33 Woolfe St. `None of the historic revitalization is ever targeted
toward black folk.""
Wicks says he has seen Blacks moved out of downtown neighborhoods
because the development of the tourism in this area caused the increasing of
home prices and made taxes unaffordable for most.
The reason why Wicks bought this house is that it was built in 1840 and it
cant be torn down!
I'm so proud of this man! He is making a real movement! Actions like this can
protect our history!","https://www.facebook.com/Black4BIack-1268698556482143/","- Living In: United States

unacceptable for us to see them ruin all we've been building for decades. For
centuries. The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but
they are wrong. We won't put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does
not talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it
mention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some
outdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a
victory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no.
We are free citizens of Texas and we've had enough of this cheap show on
the screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and
gun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but
not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher
taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist
attacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let's remind them
what Texas is made of and show that we're ready to SECEDE!

AFTER YOUNG ATHLETES TOOK A KNEE
Young people continue to take a knee during a national anthem to protest
police brutality and racial injustice in America. However, most of these
athletes paid the price for this demonstration. For instance, on September 10,
after getting permission from league officials, the staff and the students of the
Beaumont Bulls football team took a knee before their game. On the next day,
the students and the staff received death threats. Moreover, the executive
board decided to suspend Coach RahORah Barber for the rest of the season
and canceled the whole football season. So now we know what opposition
might face in this country.","https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/","United States

centuries. The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but
they are wrong. We won't put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does
not talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it
mention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some
outdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a
victory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no.
We are free citizens of Texas and we've had enough of this cheap show on
the screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and
gun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but
not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher
taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist
attacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let's remind them
what Texas is made of and show that we're ready to SECEDE!

"942","VIDEO: TEXAS SCHOOL TEACHER FIRED AFTER MANHANDLING
LITTLE BLACK BOY
The shocking video shows a Central Texas child trying to get up from a bean
bag chair in his classroom, while a Snook Independent School District
employee, Troy Vann pushing him repeatedly into it and mocking him again
and again.
After the concerned parent posted a disturbing video showing teacher
manhandling a small child on Facebook, the video went viral and it was
shared thousands of times.
In the video footage, Vann also tells the boy: ""Tell me no. When I tell you to
do something, you do it, boy.""
After the Burleson County Sheriff's Office launched an investigation, a
""behavior specialist"" who acted in an inappropriate manner with a young
student was fired.
The school district should provide a safe and secure environment for the
students. And the school should not condone or tolerate the employees who
abuse any child. The teachers who use excessive force against any child
should be removed immediately from the classroom and placed on
administrative leave. Otherwise, this will continue to happen.","https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/","United States

"2789","HILLARY CLINTON CHEATS AMERICAN VETERANS
The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans' issues was
in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans' life
improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are
some real Clinton decisions:
—Last year, Clinton claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had
been exaggerated by Republicans.
—In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007
supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans'
medical care.
-In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20
million for veterans' health care facilities.
-In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for 113 billion
for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.""
In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the
poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the
issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they
need so bad!
Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a
direct threat to the American veterans' society, but still practically no one
raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!","https://www.facebook.comNeterans-Come-First-1757336424535312/","- Living In: Turkmenistan","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

only 6 hours compared to approximately 2-4 weeks in white, Jewish, and

"433","Boston police shot and killed a man wearing body armor and wielding an
assault rifle who critically injured two officers responding to a domestic
disturbance call late Wednesday, according to Police Commissioner William
Evans.
A gun battle raged at an East Boston home as a suspect, Kirk Figueroa, 33,
of East Boston, critically injured two Boston police officers late on October
12.He was then shot and killed by other officers who ran into the home to
drag out their wounded colleagues while undergoing heavy gunfire
themselves.
This bloody massacre is a vivid example of the fact that the war with police is
too far from being OVER. It's only coming and the consequences will be
destructive if Hillary Clinton, the main hardliner against cops, will become the
President of the United States.
Defending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of
every American Patriot. Recent spate of cop killings indicates that American
national identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments
liberal elites are constantly setting up on the country.
Democrats are unable to secure the police from attacks of extremist
movements like Black Lives Matter. The Nation must unite against reverse
racism, against those who want to destroy America!
Among all the candidates Donald Trump is the one and only who can defend
the police from terrorists.","https://www.facebook.com/Being-Patriotic-1601685693432389/","United States

cooked something else entirely dangerous—cocaine. As a teenager,
Henderson manufactured and sold drugs in his native home in Los Angeles.
By 19, he was already earning US $35,000 per week. Henderson was later
apprehended and imprisoned for 10 years after one of his men was caught
carrying a big shipment. It was in prison that he discovered his natural flair for
cooking, while he was on kitchen duty.
He was released early for good behavior and soon started working for some
of LA's top restaurants before venturing into Las Vegas. After experiencing
many rejections due to his felonious past, Henderson finally managed to land
a job at Caesar's Palace. It was only a matter of time before he finally started
getting recognition and awards, including best Las Vegas Chef in 2001. All
the fame and success hasn't gotten to Henderson's head though and he has
continued to share his experiences with at-risk youth to show what they can

He said to them,""But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if
you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.""
— Luke 22:36
What does that mean? Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But
enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always
was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be
followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need
of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would
be exposed to, and of their need of protection.
And we, American Christians, should remember about it. Sometimes you
have to arm yourself to protect your loved ones and friends.","https://www.facebook.com/Army-of-Jesus-I195795607160174/","- Living In: United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

spent his public career working toward ending segregation and fighting racial
discrimination.
By recalling King's vision we can have opportunities to build a more inclusive
and just community that does not retreat from diversity but draws strength
from it. In the face of violence directed at minority communities and in a
deepening political divisions in the country, King's words and philosophy are
perhaps more critical for us today than at any point in the recent past.
We're coming together on January 15 to celebrate the life and achievements
one of the most influential American civil rights leaders. Don't forget to bring
your children with you, because it's important for them to know where they

which point, he drove off.
He added that the man ""wasn't resisting at all until they tased him""
After tasing the man police officers used their elbows and fists, as the man lay
on the ground, screaming for help.
The man was heard screaming in pain: ""My fucking back is killing me! Oh

"1107","On October 15, 1966, Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton have founded BPP.
Their idea was simple - we can't just talk to make the change, we must take
action. They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and challenge
police brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the
government and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party
""the greatest threat to the internal security of the country"". They tried to close
it, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was
dissolved.
50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country
stills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. It spreads through all the country
like the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We
need a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that
can make Black Lives really matter.

made the change. Let's honor its founders and participants. Let's share their

DROP CHARGES, CITING DOUBLE RISK
North Charleston police officer Michael Slager, who shot and killed 50-year-
old Scott after an April 2015 traffic stop, and his attorneys urged the court to
drop murder charge due to the double jeopardy that Slager faced before the
shooting. According to ex-cop's attorneys, their defendant acted in self-
defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times,
hitting Scott five times from behind.
Slager's defense attorney's:
""The double-teaming of Slager ... is a chilling example of how far politically
motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather
their own nests at the expense of a public servant ... who had to make a split-
second life or death decision that will be second-guessed by comfortable
armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.'
The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken
brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager's
dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him
about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott
jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a
bystander's video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire.
We've seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead
black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none
of them found guilty. That's why today it's important to send a message to
other police officers that if they do this, it's harsh penalty to pay.","https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/","United States

Killer cops involved in the shooting won't face discipline. Chief Janee Harteau

using deadly force in the death of the 24-year-old black man.

Manville spent three years and four months in the slammer for manslaughter.
Manville continued to study while incarcerated and eventually earned two
college degrees during his sentence. He became enamored with the legal
profession and went to law school right after his parole.
He finally passed the bar exams in Michigan and Washington, DC after
waiting many years to be approved by the respective boards. Afterwards,
Manville worked tirelessly to improve the prison system and represented
various inmates and prison guards in civil cases. Nowadays, Manville teaches
law at Michigan State University, where he hopes the insights he shares with
students inspire them to someday help improve the system as well.

era portrait
Apparently, the man's main goal was to destroy the portrait of former Texas
Governor Fletcher Stockdale. The man was arrested right in the Capitol and
charged with felony burglary and criminal mischief.
It is not clear for now if his actions were inspired by the hatred towards
Confederate symbols or namely towards Governor Stockdale.
Nevertheless, this incident perfectly illustrates how liberal propaganda
influences even on Southern people.
The names of dignified Southern politicians and warriors should not be
blurred out by Washington. These people played a huge role in American
history; they fought for their beliefs and earned people's respect.
It is absolutely unpatriotic now to demonize their names! We should protect
