"330","American Racists On The Road
The racists group of America ""Back To The Blue"" are organizing a hate rally
in response to the public outcry and protests against police officers.
""Bikers-patriots"" want to descend on the McKinney Police HQ in a show of
solidarity for the police because race-baiters and cop-haters. They plan to
have ""the biggest thing to happen in Patriot Movement since the Bundy
Ranch victory!""
It seems like we won't get into ""post-racial America"".... this event and the
regular murder of innocent Black children by white supremacist police and
citizens makes that clear. The modern government has brought racist
America to the forefront, good or bad. This is something that America has a
serious issue with - RACISM!

"343","The violent pool story #3. White police officer slammed black teen against his
car
This black family from Ohio will never forget the June 9th. According to the
family's testimony, Krystal Dixon and her sister Maya Dixon took their eight
children, nephews and nieces to Ohio public school in a Fairfield.
Nevertheless, the pool employee demanded the family to leave due to one of
the children did not have swim trunks. One of the boys broke the rules and
the staff asked the family to leave. As six-months pregnant Krystal Dixon
walked to the parking lot, the police officer grabbed her arm and asked for an
ID-card. The witness video shows how the police officer pepper sprayed
Dixon's family and grabbed 12-year-old child by neck. But according to the
Fairfield police department, the white police officer did not use excessive
force.
Did the pool staff force them to leave because they were black? Was it a race
factor? Don't you think the police officer's attempt to arrest Krystal Dixon was
unlawful? How the police officers should be charged? What kind of right of
defense do you have against unlawful arrests?
These days, there is far more to being a ""good cop"" than choosing not to hurt
innocent people. Plus, when are we going to stop being stereotypical? Even
today, the stereotypes effect black population of the United States of America
transmitted through music, lyrics, titles, literature, movies and folk saying.
White Americans across the country embrace African-Americans the image of
criminals and looters. How are we going to live with that?","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;

"429","Sadness and shocking tragedy at historically black church in Charlestone
A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other church members at black
church in Charlestone, S.0 on Wednesday night. The young clean-shaved
shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people.
Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be
investigated as hate crime.
Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American church which was
found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822.
Despite the first black American president, Africa-Americans remain the most
common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to
xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage
that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms
take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we
think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for
Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last
February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from
the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate
and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-crimes?
What if American racial change still occurs through generations? What of it
racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a
deeply racist country? What if the church is not a safe place anymore?","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;

A Texas fourth-grade teacher Karen Fitzgibbons published a racial Facebook
post in which she confirmed that Black people are responsible for racial
tensions in the USA. Moreover she claimed that she is ""almost to the point""
of defending the segregation. After her post about the recent pool party
incident drew local attention, the teacher deleted her profile.
""This makes me ANGRY! This officer should not have had to resign. I'm
going to just go ahead and say it....the blacks are the ones causing the
problems and this `racial tension. I guess that's what happens when you
flunk out of school and have no education. I'm sure their parents are just as
guilty for not knowing what their kids were doing; or knew it and didn't care,""
she wrote. She also added,""I'm almost to the point of wanting them all
segregated on one side of town so they can hurt each other and leave the
innocent people alone. Maybe the 50s and 60s were really on to something.

As we see Karen Fitzgibbons is a real racist, who approves the humiliation of
black people! This news clearly reflects that American society is close to
collapse, if not to say to war. As the authorities are doing nothing to resolve
the situation, in the near future we may face real race war within our country.","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;

"654","NOM'S LAST ATTEMPT TO BAN SAME SEX MARRIAGE
National Organization for Marriage is asking all of the GOP presidential
candidates to sign an anti-equality pledge. Let's take a look at just how crazy
this pledge gets.
That's just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional
amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last
decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55
percent!
But they don't stop there. NOM also wants candidates to ""work to overturn
any Supreme Court decision"" in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants
the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at
this point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that
supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn't qualified to be a judge.
Also, NOM wants the candidates to weaken civil rights laws, creating
loopholes to let companies and citizens to discriminate if they cite a religious
justification. That could actually happen — and it already has in some states —
so it's a huge concern.
And fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment
against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are
harassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated
from their families, but I really hope soon there'll be NO MORE of it!
There's a part of me that feels very sad for NOM's fanatics. When they
finally kick the bucket, they'll be dealing with the reality (whether they openly
face it or not) that their Life's Work has amounted to NOTHING. Nothing they
worked for made anyone's life better. At all.
They didn't win, and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable.
And when they're dead and gone, they'll be remembered only as footnotes
in shameful history — or more likely they'll be forgotten completely.

Ruby Rose has long been the celebrity crush of lesbians the world over. But
now that she's a star in 'Orange is the New Black', the popularity of this
model, actress, and VJ has grown worldwide.
""Gender fluidity is not really feeling like you're at one end of the spectrum or
the other. For the most part, I definitely don't identify as any gender,"" - Rose
said; - ""I'm not a guy; I don't really feel like a woman, but obviously I was born
one. As a little kid, I was convinced that I was a guy. Then in my teens, I tried
to be quite feminine...And after a little bit, chopped everything off and am kind
of back where I started. So, I'm somewhere in the middle, which - in my
perfect imagination - is like having the best of both sexes.""

stop gun-related violence, like the Wednesday massacre at Emmanuel

It's strange to hear it from the man who supported 2nd amendment earlier.
The lack of clear-cut opinion is very bad character trait. However, it doesn't
matter.
The right to bear arms is inalienable right of Americans that was given us by
the Founding Fathers. The 2nd amendment guarantees private safety of the
people. The right to keep and bear arms has been recognized as existing
prior even to the creation of a written national constitution. The govermmnet
should respect the 2nd amendment and the law in general. It's pity when
some politicians think otherwise.
People should understand that a gun is not a killing tool, it's self-defense tool.

Transgender teen Mercedes Williamson was found dead in a wooded area.
She is the ninth confirmed transgender homicide victim in the USA this year.
Police in George County. Mississippi have charged a suspect Josh Brandon
Vallum. Police said that Mercedes and Josh knew each other, but it is not
clear if Vallum knew Williamson was a transgender. Jeanie Miller, whom
Williamson had been living with, said that Vallum knew that Williamson was
transgender.
Modern America is too dangerous for transgenders. This is the ninth
transgender killing based on gender identity. According to the National
Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs' report hate-motivated violence against
transgenders rose 13%. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to live as a
transgender in the South. Alabama even passed a religious freedom law in
1998 that allows discrimination against LGBT people. That also allows
lawmakers to justify hostility toward transgender people. And that we call
`freedom'? America is no longer land of freedom!","https://www.facebook.com/LGBT-United-839497472793277/","- Living In: United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

Cleve Jones, a human rights activist, who was mentored by Harvey Milk.
It is proposed that the class will begin in autumn. Really perfect idea! There
are at least twenty eight percent of LGBT students in Asawa High School. It is
the fact that we need such classes in every American school! Children
shouldn't be afraid to show who they are; they shouldn't be afraid to speak
about LGBT history; they should know that it is normal to be gay or lesbian or
transgender. Everybody should be taught to understand LGBT people and
recognize them as ordinary citizens.","https://www.facebook.com/LGBT-United-839497472793277/","- Living In: United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

But Obama's administration is tied to the chariot of immigrants. Democrats
know that immigrants will vote for the Democratic party. Especially former

illegals as soon as possible. It will allow to increase a number of votes for a

to death
Today, the pool party in Georgia is even more shocking than a recent pool
party in Texas. A young man from Georgia was shot to death at a pool party
at Fayette. It was an advertised on social 200 teenager's pool party which
ended up with shootings of unknown assailant for unknown reasons. One of
the five injured, a 19-year-old black teenager Clanton passed away on the
way to hospital.
In fact, the media has not made a transparent effort to cover up the incident.
Why the pool party in Georgia is a silent story? Why the police was not aware
of a large party? Why this story has no national outrage? Is it ok when a black
teenager dies?
Unfortunately, the responding police officers were not able to prevent the
tragedy. From these facts one might conclude, police officers know the
easiest ways to arrest people, but they are irresponsible to avoid the
shootings at the average pool party.","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;

What is the most important thing the government must to do this year in order
our country to live in peace?
The criminal justice system is very important institution where law
enforcement investigate a crime gathering evidences to identify the presumed
perpetrator ensuring that rights of the convicted are respected. But what if
American criminal justice reform outdated and the country need to focus on a
renewed sense of justice? What if disproportionate punishment is the main
challenge of the criminal justice system?
Disproportionate punishments known far and wide across the United States of
America. Consequently, the victim's skin color plays a crucial role in deciding
what kind of punishment he will receive. For instance, you are more likely to
be sentenced to death if you have killed a white person. Frankly speaking, if
the government wants to keep the country away from the summer urban riots,
then they must think about the living standards of black population that is
several times below the living standards of white people in America. In
addition, the White House must reduce the unemployment rates of black
population by revising the hiring policy for black Americans.Therefore, if we
want a life's balance, the government have to reconsider all these things,
because Black Americans lives matter.","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;

Niggerized Black President""
Reacting to President Obama's use of the n-word on Marc Maron's podcast,
Cornel West called him the first ""niggerized"" president in an appearance on
CNN. West criticized Obama as ""a person who is afraid and intimidated when
it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy.""
""A niggerized black person is a black person who is afraid and scared and
intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy and
fighting against white supremacy,"" West explained. ""So when many of us said
we have to fight against racism, what were we told?'No, he can't deal with
racism because he has other issues, political calculations. He's the president
of all America, not just black America.' We know he's president of all America
but white supremacy is American as cherry pie.""
West is right as usual. African minorities would choose Mr. West in 2009 and
2012 instead of Obama. But we had no choice. Cornel is a good leader, he
knows what black community is suffering from. Obama was promoted by big
corporations owned by white people. Obama never tried to protect blacks
from police pressure, never tried to stop police violence against blacks. Just
count how many black lives were destroyed during his presidency. The

records, just for making money. American society at all levels became too
corruptive, starting from our government and ending with ordinary citizens. On
the contrary Tupac did his music to influence the world. That's why he spoke
to issues of poverty, oppression and racism.
Today young African-Americans have fallen under bad influence of money,
drugs and so on. Yeah, it is all started from the government's attitude
towards Blacks. But let's remember Tupac and his ability to question the
social order. Changes, one of his popular songs, asks everyone to change
their lifestyles for better society. He always asked people to share with each
other and to learn to love each other.","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;

fraud. Simply she was given a task to join the association of black community

The autopsy report suggested that Gray may have attempted to stand up
during the van ride, and that the injury could have occurred as he was thrown
against the van wall when the vehicle changed direction. Like really? When
police took Gray to the hospital, doctors determined that he had sustained a
severed spine and crushed voice box. High-energy injury? We don't think so.
It's hard to believe. Do they think we're idiots or something?
Cops imprison you, shoot you, sever your spine, crush your larynx, send you
to war, keep you poor, call you a thug and get away with it. There's no excuse
for what happened to Freddie.","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;

"341","Sadness and shocking tragedy at historically black church in Charlestone
*CLICK TO GET LIVE UPDATES ON OUR PAGE*
A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other church members at black
church in Charlestone, S.0 on Wednesday night. The young clean-shaved
shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people.
Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be
investigated as hate crime.
Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American church which was
found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822.
Despite the first black American president, Africa-Americans remain the most
common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to
xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage
that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms
take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we
think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for
Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last
February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from
the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate
and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-crimes?
What if American racial change still occurs through generations? What of it
racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a
deeply racist country? What if the church is not a safe place anymore?

"596","THE US ARMY HAS PUNISHED CHELSEA MANNING for possessing books
and magazines having to do with LGBTQ and political issues.
They accused her of misconduct for having an expired tube of toothpaste and
for brushing food off the table. They placed her in a solitary confinement — a
torturous, extremely distressing experience. The whole cruel, corrupted
system is against her.
It looks like military prosecutors view Manning in a way that means she must
be ""broken"" or forcefully assimilated because of her crime —first, because she
exposed the government's crimes, and government really doesn't like it, and
second, because she's trans.
Their goal is to see that Manning is as dehumanized as possible, but it's clear
who the real non-humans are. Someone has gone to great lengths to paint
Chelsea as a deceitful and psychotic character.
But how many of those punishing Manning should themselves be in a psych
ward?
Transphobia is a one ugly thing. So sad when heroes like Chelsea Manning
forced to suffer, to undergo injustice and humiliation, even though they had
been through enough already!

"442","The threat of possible ISIS attacks on the U.S. Military families has risen
U.S. Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado said in a statement
that he was alarmed by the reports of an FBI alert that relatives of the US
military personnel in Wyoming and Colorado were harassed outside their
homes by Middle Eastern men and might have been under surveillance. A
copy of the alert said that the wife of a U.S. military member was approached
in front of her home in Colorado by two men. The incident took place in May.
Similar incidents in Wyoming repeated in June.
We see that the threat of possible ISIS attack on families of the U.S. military
has risen. And when the threat is so real the US intelligence agencies are
doing nothing. As a matter of the fact they don't fully perform their duties.
First of all, the US security forces should take all appropriate measures to
identify people who scour after the wives and children of the U.S. Military.
Secondly, families of the U.S. Military should be taken under special
protection of the police and the FBI. If even one hair of the U.S. Military family
members will be lost then the work of American secret services isn't worth a
dime as they cannot maintain security on the American soil. In case of a
negative scenario there won't be any need in their work. And this will be the
final nail in the coffin of the American secret services.
Let's remember the last FBI and NSA failures, such as failure to stop the
Boston Marathon Bombings and so on. Our soldiers fight for America at the
other end of the world and they deserve that their families should be kept
safe.","https://www.facebook.com/patriototus","United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

"172","Because They Lack Crucial Training, These Cops Severely Beat a Blind
Autistic Teen Unconscious
During the incident, Abrams, 17, suffered two seizures after police used force
against him at the Green Line's Lexington Parkway Station.
The teen suffers from Asperger's syndrome, which causes him to strongly
dislike being touched or having people in his person space, and is considered
legally blind, wearing extremely magnified glasses.
Officers thought the non-compliance of Abrams was reason enough to justify
forcibly taking him down, which resulted in him being battered and left
unconscious.
Abrams non-compliance wasn't done out of malice, but out of not really
understanding the situation, and believing he hadn't done anything wrong.
Abrams' autism makes it extremely difficult for him to interpret the intentions
or feelings of others, according to his mother. Police released the teen to the
custody of his mother rather than take him to the juvenile detention facility.
Police are trained to think like the military in combat, which means they
prioritize their own safety and the safety of fellow officers over everything
else, including that of the citizens they allegedly ""protect and serve.""","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;

"448","The Census Bureau published the new data in its International Data Base,
which contains population estimates and projections up to the year 2050. The
figure from the Census Bureau is a calculation of net migration—meaning the
total number of immigrants who will arrive in the United States in 2015 would
actually be larger than 1.24 million.
Of course, the United States is the country of immigrants. But if America had
huge undeveloped lands and needed workers at the earliest stage, today
there is a jobs deficit. Today the government must restrict immigration that is
a reason of interethnic tensions in the United States. High unemployment rate
fuels intolerance toward immigrants that are ready to work illegally for low
wages. So, besides social problem, immigrants threaten the U.S. economy.
Those who work illegaly don't pay taxes that are an important part of state
budget. Working illegaly, they break the law. Lack of immigration restrictions
increases crime rates.
Moreover, more and more immigrants cannot speak English. One-fifth of
people in the United States speak a foreign language at home, according to a
report of the Center for Immigration Studies.
You see, increasing ammount of immigrants in the United States creates
social and economic problems. However, we have a risk not only to worsen
the U.S. economy, but also to lose our culture. America can't be the Tower of
Babel, we cannot allow everybody to live here if immigration threatens us. We
don't hate foreigners, we are glad to see tourists from every corner of the
world, but we cannot allow them to stay here.
It's the bathos of stupidity to stimulate immigration when it creates enormous

"177","Know your rights and your freedom
The murders of Michael Brown, Tryvon Martin, Freddie Gray, Eric Gartner
and other black victims have dramatized depth of racism in America society.
They were young and Black- that was enough for police officers to decide that
they looked suspicious. The police brutality has sparked the movement and
has emerged to demand justice and political attention. However, the everyday
racism we see was not understood, but ignored. Moreover, the government
along with the law enforcement violate our rights through the illegal use of
force and mass arrests in order to obstruct our free expression.
Yes, standing up for your right to protest for the equality and justice is
challenging, but it's worth discrimination and unfairness black civilians face
everyday. Remember, knowing your rights can be the most powerful weapon
you have against police abuse and brutality.
The most famous civil rights activists represent a basic philosophy, known for
their fight against injustice and lasting profound impact in the lives of African-
Americans. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Mary McLeod Bethune, Rosa
Parks changed our lives forever.
But what changes have you made? Have you contributed to a greater
equality? What are you doing to fight against injustice and racism? Have you
ever protested in civil rights protests or have you ever been part of Black
Lives Matter movement? How do your protect your right to free expression?

Passing the ""First Amendment Defense Act"" introduced by Sen. Mike Lee
has been anti-LGBT conservatives' top priority since the Supreme Court
brought marriage equality to all 50 states. It's part of the National
Organization for Marriage's post-Obergefell plan and Republican presidential
candidate pledge, and the Family Research Council mentions it almost daily.
Lee joined NPR this week to defend the bill, basically admitting that all it does
is enable anti-gay discrimination.
Lee framed his concern as one about the government discriminating against
religious institutions —for discriminating against people in same-sex
marriages. It's the latter he wants to allow by ensuring that the government
never penalizes any religious institution that refuses to recognize a same-sex
couple's marriage, or employ them, house them, or serve them.
Mr. Lee, you are ridiculous! You're just going to have to get over that fact that
we have full Federal civil rights now. Or don't! We will go on happily living our
lives while you froth at the mouth and throw a fit because we're being treated

CHANGE 'F' TO 'M' ON DRIVER'S LICENSE.
One of the friends of our group shared his story with us! He has been
discriminated against by local authorities in Louisville, Ky.
There's a gap between Kentucky law and federal law. People trying to change
the gender on a passport only need to be in transition, not post-surgery.
But many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical
reasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these
people's circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats.
It is very important for every transgender to be able to change his\her
identification to reflect who they really are. It's not just about person dressed
as a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is
about much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man
or woman only presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they
were assigned to at birth.
Transgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification
changes. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible.
Because it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you
were assigned to at birth.
Please share your stories with us, because united we can stand against
injustice and inequality!

there's no doubt in our minds she is a supporter of the LGBT community.
And of course this world always need an amazing power of woman's touch:-)
Isn't it just amazing? Wonder Woman presides over the wedding of two
brides in Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman, Chapter 48 written
and illustrated by Jason Badower.
Badower said he also really wanted to reference current affairs in the story -
specifically, legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide.
""I saw this Wonder Woman story as an incredible opportunity to have one of
the most recognizable, iconic characters in the world to be among the first to
step forward and officially endorse this new law,"" he said. ""I thought, let's not
just have Wonder Woman embrace this new law, let's have her celebrate it.""
Some may ask — why is it so important when superheroes depicted as
supporters of marriage equality? Because it is a massive, land-mark
milestone in LBGTQ rights history.
Because the fight to get to normal was so difficult, and because the fight to
change normal is still ongoing. Just like Wonder Woman using her
superpowers to struggle with violence and injustice of the world! :-)

Tamir Rice, Rumain Brisbon, Kajieme Powel, Dante Parker, Michael Brown,

used on black Americans.
You never know if a simple traffic stop will end up with you in a police custody

Unfortunately, many of Americans feel very uncomfortable talking about these
issues, which seem to confirm the idea that the government remain silent.
Nevertheless, one should accept that African-Americans are more likely to be
targeted by police officers on the street than whites. Therefore it endangers
the rights of black community.
Doubtless when the government defends the officers who have killed black
men, it strikes us how unfair the system is and reaffirms our view that America
would spend billions of dollars on radical extremists than talking about the
domestic terrorism, racial inequality and police brutality.","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","- Living In: United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis

Residents of Huntsville, Alabama who declined to intervene to help a police
officer subdue a suspect could face criminal prosecution under a state statute
requiring them to assist an officer in trouble. Had the situation been reversed,
however, police officers would face neither criminal nor civil prosecution for
declining to aid a citizen under assault by a suspect.
A man named Devonte Conerly who was suspected in a hit and run incident,
allegedly tried to disarm the police officer who stopped him. Several officers
responded to a call for assistance and eventually subdued and handcuffed
Conerly. They then rebuked several bystanders who had declined to
intervene.
Bystanders are not liable to prosecution if the failure to render aid ""was
reasonable under the circumstances,"" but the burden of demonstrating that
this is the case is placed upon the accused.

"431","Barack Obama and his team have spent two months working to secure 41
percent for Iran deal. And now they claim enourmous victory.
Under the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the
Senate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect — a legally binding long-
term agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of
dollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed.
Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been
obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can
never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in
2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and
the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama.
But Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to change a
subject to a vote — not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be
treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and
the Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his
presidential veto.
The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to
overturn such a veto — and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So,
instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67
senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or
more Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to
support the deal.
Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will
simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking
and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42
percent.
Barack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn't care
about Americans. All what he cares is his outsized ambitions.","https://www.facebook.com/patriototus","United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

States across the country were filled with flows of refugees since Obama
became the President. The U.S. refugee admissions database wrapsnet.org
states that 437,829 new refugees came to the USA since Obama first took
office. Most of them were placed in Texas (46,351), California (44,162) and
New York (26,293). Many of refugees were placed in Ohio (14,855), Florida
(21,613), Virginia (9,395), Colorado (11,300) and Nevada (3,421).
Such active provision of a shelter for refugees sooner or later will lead to the
fact that the number of terrorist attacks in the USA will increase. The US
Homeland Security Committee considers that the administration is admitting
too many refugees from Iraq and Syria, a hotbed of ISIS terrorism. Perhaps
new terrorist attacks won't be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more
terrorist attacks if the immigration policy won't be tightened.

the U.S. Embassy in Cuba where the American flag will be raised. The

`My inspiration is thinking about 90 miles separating the two countries and
the two people, 90 miles is the sea between us.' Just 90 miles, but at the
same time it is a vast schism that separates the United States from Cuba.
The poet added he hopes there's still possible to achieve ""healing"" between
the two countries.
`This very moment, the negotiation of cultural identities...This just seems so
surreal still... This is really in some sense just the beginning, the dawn of new
things to come.'
It would be so great if it will be indeed a new hope and a new day for Cuba,
country which is still struggling to recover from severe embargo, country
abused by wars. Sadly, the United States participated and initiated many of
these conflicts... And there's more - severe economic crisis, socialist
dictatorship of Cuban leaders.
It's time for us to lend a helping hand.

Chuck Wendig, author of Star Wars: Aftermath, said: ""I don't think his

"118","Ta-Nehisi Coates on growing up in West Baltimore
The famous African-American writer Ta-Nehisi Coates grew up in West
Baltimore with people who lost a child whether to the streets, to guns or to jail.
Today, his goal is to protect his son from the different forms of violence that
he experienced in school and on the streets.
People of color have been dealing with injustice ever since they crossed the
North American continent. For instance, in West Baltimore, Ta-Nehisi was
trained not to go to the neighborhoods unless you know this place. He was
told that you cannot tolerate anybody attempting any physically violent threat
to you. Moreover, his mom was feared that her children would get arrested.
What does it mean? Undoubtedly, black Americans were afraid of police,
improper procedure, injustice or what is worse, being killed by police officer.
That's why the nationwide furor over the growing number of unarmed black
men fatally shot by police officers has put the public on a new trend in
America. In fact, this new trend caused disproportionate number of unarmed
people of color killed by police.

children about how safely interact with police officers in order to protect
themselves?
Tina Carter-Shileds has five kids and three of them recently started to drive.
The first thought she had when they wanted to drive alone was 'Wait a
minute. I'm really scared right now.' What should they do if they get pulled
over? What if they do something they don't supposed to be doing? It is not
always fair when officers arrest African Americans, but it's a reality. What if
police officers will automatically assume that your child is criminal because of
how him or her looks.
Black parents should remember that their kids will always be judged by the
way they look. That's why it's important to instruct our children how to react
when you are in trouble with law enforcement. Because if a stranger follows
your child after him/her buy a bag of Skittles, ran back into the store.
Remember, anything is better than dying.
Anyways, it's hard to believe that in 21 st century black parents have to teach
their children both survive and thrive. But who will take responsibility for

"643","Please ... STOP DISCRIMINATION AGAINST HOMOSEXUAL TEACHERS!!
After eight years on the job, Margie Winters was fired as director of religious
education at Waldron Mercy Academy outside Philadelphia not because she
just married her wife, but because some parents just found out that she's
been married for all eight years.
Unfortunately LGBT teachers have long understood that openly expressing
their identity in school can make them an easy target for discrimination. It is
the biggest mistake!
When students perceive that they're not supposed to talk about
homosexuality, they conclude that there must be something wrong about
being gay. And it's a dangerous message that can lead to bullying and
harassment.
Gay teachers need to serve as example for kids! It's very powerful both for
straight students and for LGBT students to know that they have teachers and
people they respect who are LGBT and who are good at their jobs. It's
important for all students to see that nothing to be ashamed! And it must be
illegal for employers to discriminate against employees based on their actual
or perceived sexual orientation!","https://www.facebook.com/LGBT-United-839497472793277/","- Living In: United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

"634","Most parents aren't prepared for the words, ""Mom, Dad. I'm gay."" For many
parents first reaction probably will be ""How will I ever handle this?"" The
answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help
to understand your child's sexuality and its meaning to you and your
continued relationship with your son or daughter.
Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their
child's sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as
problem-free - overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during
that time.
Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening - by rejecting what they're
hearing (""It's just a phase; you'll get over it""); by shutting down (""If you
choose that lifestyle, I don't want to hear about it""); or by not registering the
impact of what we're being told (""That's nice, dear, and what do you want
for dinner?"").
Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT children. If
you as a parent 'II pretend to forgot the truth about your child's sexuality, you
would never really know your child. A large part of his or her life would be kept
secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person.
It is important to accept and understand your child's sexuality because
homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment
for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of
telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through ""a phase"".
On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding
and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you're wondering, ""Is
she/he sure?"" the answer will almost always be ""yes""!
DON'T BE YOUR CHILD'S FIRST CLOSET!

A teenager shot by city police is paralyzed below the waist, his mother said
Sunday as her family copes with another episode of gun violence. Not seven
years ago, her teenage daughter was accidentally shot to death.
This time, a firearm in the hand of her son, Brandon Claxton, 16, prompted an
officer to shoot him three times about 7:15 p.m. Saturday in a housing
complex in the 2500 block of Hodiamont Avenue, officials said. Police
encountered him while responding to a call about someone with a stolen
pistol.
His mother said that she respected the police and that her son ""shouldn't
have had the gun."" But from what witnesses have told her, she said, ""They
didn't have to shoot him down like that.""
One of three witnesses interviewed Sunday told a reporter that Brandon did
have a gun in his hand. But all three said that he did not point a weapon at
anyone as he tried to run from officers.
When a white guy walks around with a rifle, nobody bats an eye. When a
black guy walks with a pistol (or even a toy gun)- he'll be immediately shot by
the police. Have you ever heard about open carry in the United States? Then
here we go. Racial prejudice at its finest.

"163","Are you going to vote in this presidential election as young black male or
female?
The founder and editor-in-chief of Black Millennial and one of the organizers
of Black Lives Matter NYC Arielle Newton is 23-years-old. She is black
college-educated woman who is drawing in $160,000 student loan debt.
Today, Arielle is centered on the roots causes racism and resulting epidemic
discrimination and socioeconomic illness. In fact, in her opinion the
candidates for the next president of the United States of America are
problematic in terms of lack of transparency and accountability. For instance,
one candidate is complicit in fueling the war on drugs; another one in
corrupted criminal justice system, next one in making racial justice as the
centerpiece of the campaign as a strategy to have more black voters.
Doubtless, voting won't bring us safety and won't provide us an immediate
conduit for our social well-being. Ironically, even the first black president of
the United States of America was not able to withstand the racist opposition
and law enforcement. It means voting again for anti-black system won't save
black lives, but might jeopardize it.","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","- Living In: United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis

A predominantly Melbourne black church was vandalized for the third time in

Jacquelyn Gordon said that the church was in the process of development

Moreover, the message ""SS Charleston 2"" was found on the car nearby the
Church, which raised concerns about church security. SS Charleston 2

white supremacist Dylann Roof at Emanuel AME church. Before, the church
members found the words ""We see u"" that were painted in the radical emblem
of the Nazi party swastika.

The WWII veteran Johnnie H. Hodges refused to leave his house after he was
not able to pay his mortgage while caring for his sick wife. Police and
ambulance workers had to carry him away on a stretcher.
A 90-year-old Navy veteran lived in his Buffalo home with his wife for
decades. But about four years ago; he was taking care of his wife, who had
Alzheimer's disease and spent all his income on her rehabilitation. In the
process, he defaulted on his mortgage and amassed a huge debt totaling
$73;000 to M&T Bank. Unfortunately, due to his default on his mortgage loan
payments, he was evicted from his house on a stretcher.
Why does the U.S. government treat military veterans absolutely
disgracefully? Why the WWII veterans are literally being treated like human
garbage by their own government? How potentially disabled veteran was

""Do black females lives matter, too?""
That's the big question 16-year-old Amandla Stenberg posed on Instagram on
Sunday. The powerful post broke down the cultural double standards that
plague black women every day.
""Black features are beautiful, black women are not,"" Stenberg wrote. ""White
women are paragons of virtue and desire, black women are objects of
fetishism and brutality. This, at least, seems to be the mentality surrounding
black femininity and beauty in a society built upon eurocentric beauty
standards.""
Everybody knows that racism is alive and prospering in America. However, all
the news about killing black men and black teenagers, police brutality, unfair
sentences and other issues, distract us from the fact that black women are
being abused in the most violent ways. Usually they can't stand up for
themselves unlike men, so they endure and suffer.
In modern America black women experience more depression than probably
during slavery, when everything was obvious, but now racism is hidden
behind the mask of tolerance.","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;

some liberals ban even the Old Glory -- a school district in Tennessee has
banned all flags and banners, including the U.S. flag -- and so on. The same

Wednesday night, a white police officer in the small town of Stonewall,
Mississippi allegedly strangled Sanders, a 39-year-old black horseman, with a

Officer Kevin Herrington pulled Sanders off a horse and choked him with a
flashlight, Sander's attorney, Stewart Parrish, initially told an ABC affiliate.
Parrish later clarified that those allegations came from family members who
witnessed the death. Parrish said that Sanders experienced ""some kind of
asphyxiation"" during the altercation.
Sanders died on the scene and leaves behind two children.

"546","35,093 vets were left without medical assistance
According to an internal document obtained by media, 35,093 combat
veterans are being denied health care enrollment by the Department of
Veterans Affairs because of a computer system error. The vast majority of
these combat vets served in Afghanistan and Iraq. About 19,000 of them have
been pending one month and five years and about 16,000 have been pending
for more than five years. It is known that after five years vets lose their
eligibility for free health care. Moreover approx. one-third of 847,000 vets with
pending applications for health care had already died.
Well, this story clearly demonstrates what value for the state the life of a man
willing to sacrifice means. In fact the government doesn't care about its
soldiers, even if they are heroes. This confirms that the government's
slapdash attitude to the recording vets system left more than 35,000 veterans
without medical assistance. And how many of them died before the error in
the database was revealed! A truly disgusting attitude to our soldiers!","https://www.facebook.com/patriototus","United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

"140","The drama in Pocomoke. A Maryland town several weeks ago fired its first
black Police Chief, now exposing a racial rift
The leaders of small Maryland's city in Eastern Shore fired the Pocomoke
City's first black police Chief Kelvin Sewell due to his incompetence and
refusal to fire black police officers Franklin Savage and Lynell Green. Chief
Sewell was hired by Pocomoke City back in 2010 after his retirement from the
Baltimore Police Department. Earlier, before Sewell's dismissal he filed a
complaint on unequal employment opportunities claiming he was paid less
than his white predecessors.
This is circumstantial evidence that America is divided into different parts
based on race and income. Racism has gotten so bad, black people are
treated unfairly. If God created us equally, why the unequal treatment of
minorities still exists in our country? What if the firing gas stirred a new spirit
of African-American activism?","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","- Living In: United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis

was trying to run away from the officers.
Where is the video evidence of police shooting? Police Chief Sam Dotson
said that there is not a clear view on video. What if police is trying to cover up

"639","SOLDIER SHANE.
Recently Pentagon confirmed plan to lift ban on transgender military service.
Let's meet the big player in repealing the ban.
Sergeant Shane Ortega, 28, doesn't stand out or appear out of the ordinary
among his fellow Army soldiers.
But there's one thing that differs him from the bulk of troops. Shane is the first
openly trans soldier of the US Army.
He's astonishingly handsome, he works out constantly (check out his
muscular build), he covered in tattoos, he's part black, Latino and Cherokee,
he's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he
gets giddy talking about both video games and chopping wood in Alaska.
Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has
been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army
paperwork, he is identified as a woman.
But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for
the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded!
America's military progressing slowly towards inclusion and equal opportunity.
Let's hope that these changes'll ensure peace, instead of waging more war.

A man in Alabama collapsed and died after officers sprayed him with pepper
spray while arresting him after a chase, Tuscaloosa police said Saturday.
Police said Ware ran into nearby woods and struggled with officers when they
caught up with him. Officers sprayed him with oleoresin capsicum, more
commonly known as pepper spray, according to police. The chemical agent
debilitates a person by causing temporary blindness and irritating a person's
nose and throat.
The six officers who were involved in Ware's case will remain on duty during
an investigation, according to police. Officials said police car dash cam and
body camera footage of the incident would be released after that
investigation.
This tragedy happen accidentally, and probably the police officers didn't wish
death upon him, because they tried to give him first aid. However, the man is
dead and there is no chance to rewind and bring him back. He's gone forever,
but the cops will remain on duty and get away with this murder. Is this
acceptable?
We will know about he process of detention after the investigation is over.

surplus of military equipment. However, there is more work to be done to
solve racial tensions in America.
The public stand against discrimination happens when there is lack of inside

Do you know the best way to ruin your career in the US? Follow the rules and
the ""miracle"" won't be late in arriving.
I bet you remember the white former officer who shot and killed an unarmed
black teen in Ferguson, last August? After national debate over the
relationship between police and black communities Darren Wilson aka ""Bad
cop, who killed innocent black child"" tried to go back to police work but was
turned down because he's too big a liability.
In the recent interview to New Yorker magazine he said, ""It's too hot an issue,
so it makes me unemployable.""
So what does the situation mean to America?
Almost nothing except one thing... a man's life may be ruined because he had
the audacity to defend himself against huge man with malicious intent.
Michael Brown was a thug, who had just assaulted a store owner, and robbed
him. Do you have any idea what should police officer do in such situation? He
must stop the criminal, period. He was in a no-win situation and it proves how
upside-down society has become.
I wonder, what will be the next step of American justice degradation? Will
surgeons be fired for operate patients with knives? Will Supreme Court send
teachers to jail for teaching?
Instead hate Wilson, we should pray for him. He did nothing wrong but idiots
turned society against an innocent man. So is it a new America?","https://www.facebook.com/patriototus","United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

the biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or
disorderly conduct.
The New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit
with summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what
should we do?
The criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be changed. The worse, it
is now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep
people in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a
business.
The first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government
will start to sell indulgences soon.
Our system is not only unfair, but also corrupt! We should explore alternative
solutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and
potentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail!
Lemme ask you, have you ever seen a one of the tobacco industry executives
go to jail? I guess no. We also have never seen the Bush or any other
Presidents administrations were brought to justice.
America has a justice system that was supplanted the Jim Crow laws as a
means to keep the minorities from developing real opportunities for keeping
the very rich from ever being brought to justice.","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","- Living In: United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis

Raynette Turner
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman will launch an investigation
into to the death of one of the five black women who died in an American jail
over a two-week span. Raynette Tumer who was the mother of eight children
died in jail cell in police custody last week. She was arrested for shoplifting
some crab legs from a grocery store. Due to her bad health history she was
taken to the hospital and released. But she died in jail waiting for someone to
help.
According to American legislation, the courthouse officials are supposed to
check the cell every fifteen minutes but, no one checked Tumer's cell for
more than two hours.
A total of five African-American women have been found dead in police
custody in just the last month. Most of them were hold for minor charges and
still their deaths are under investigation. Sandra Bland from Texas, Kindra
Chapman from Alabama, Joyce Curnell from South Carolina, Ralkina Jones
from Ohio, and Raynetta Turner from New York were found dead in their cell
after being arrested by police officers.
Once again it raises questions about how black people are treated in police
custody. What if death in police custody is about excessive police force? Do

it is becoming dangerous.
So, a family from Moseley, Virginia was threatened at gunpoint for waving the
Confederate flag on their own private property on Monday night. While the
family was expressing their First Amendment right by waving the flag in their
own driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the
driveway, took out his gun, chambered a round, pointed it at the family.
""He slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me, he pulled out a
gun, chambered a round and told me my cause wasn't worth anything now,""
Mark Wilson said.
When one spits upon the law because he thinks that it's amoral, it is
beginning a chaos. Liberals want to ban a confederate flag because slavery
was in the 18th and 19th centuries. They don't want to understand that
slavery was legal in many countries of the world, but nobody wants to ban a
flag of England or France.
Activists and groups like the NAACP are also calling for statues and
monuments to Confederate leaders to be demolished, including the carving at
Stone Mountain, the largest bas relief sculpture in the world. Some are even
demanding that Washington, DC be renamed in the name of political
correctness because George Washington owned slaves.
Liberals actually want to destroy American history and culture. Americans
should be guided by the law, because sometimes moral is not clear. If

eliminate the party.

contrast, Obama ordered the flags to half-staff following on the same day that
as the shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The flag was lowered
to half-staff the day following the terrorist attack during the Boston marathon,
the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard and the following the death of
Nelson Mandela. But it hasn't yet been lowered in honor of the service
members murdered in Tennessee.
By doing so Obama shows the highest degree of disrespect for the fallen
soldiers. It turns out that for him the soldiers as well as veterans do not
deserve any attention or respect. Soldiers are needed only when it is
necessary to send them to the next unknown operation. They considered as
meat. But in reality, they are our heroes! They were victims of a terrorist
attack. They were victims of a man who at first won refugee status and then
decided to kill in the name of Allah.
In general during the Obama presidency the country was divided in many
ways: racism became more evident, the number of illegal immigrants, who do
not even bother to learn English, because it's enough to speak Spanish, has
increased.","https://www.facebook.com/patriototus","United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

Oakland police officers fatally shot a man suspected in alleged carjacking
attempt in Downtown Oakland Wednesday night. Is it a race war?
Yesterday night. a group of 50 protesters burned Confederate flag and tried to
shutdown a freeway in Downtown Oakland. The opposition to police violence
was in response to the police shooting earlier in the day.
According to Oakland Police Department, yesterday at 2:39 p.m. in the area
of 69th Avenue and International Boulevard. Oakland police officers spotted a
vehicle they believe to be connected to a previous robbery on July 27. The
pursuit started when the driver fled through Oakland streets until the suspect
crashed into another car in the area of 27th Avenue and Martin Luther King
Jr. street. But when the suspect ran of the car, three officers opened fire. The
suspect Joe Bart has died at the hospital.
Did you know that it was fifth shooting this year that involved police officers?
How quickly it has become so usual? Why it has become so legit? Where is
the government speaking about the existence of racism in America?

For decades, conservative Christians who oppose LGBT equality have
singled out the federal government or secular atheists as their preferred
enemy in public settings, blasting both groups for supposedly attacking
""traditional marriage"" or infringing on their religious liberty.
Yet in the months surrounding the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to
legalize same-sex marriage across the country, right-wing Christians have
become increasingly willing to cast blame — seemingly hypocritically — on a
group they have often dismissed or outright ignored: Progressive Christians,
especially those who support marriage equality.

noticed while progressive Christians are constantly under attack from
conservative Christians, they're not the ones screaming ""persecution"". They

A divided Ohio appeals court panel on Friday said it would not force a
municipal judge to issue arrest warrants for Cleveland police officers involved
in the fatal shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in a city park last November.
Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Ronald Adrine in June found probable
cause for Officer Timothy Loehmann, who shot Rice, and his partner, Frank
Garmback, to face charges in the shooting.
Loehmann shot Rice twice within seconds of arriving outside a city recreation
center on Nov. 22 in response to an emergency call of a man with a gun.
Rice, who was playing with an Airsoft-type replica handgun that shoots
pellets, died the next day.
By any means the justice system is trying to justify the cops, who should've
been never employed even. They shot the poor kid in 2 seconds after they
arrived, not even having time to understand the situation. Everyday police use
excessive force and weapons against unarmed people. Killers in uniform...

"147","Young, Unarmed Black Man Killed By Cop Didn't Want To'Die Too Young'
An unarmed black teenager in Texas was shot dead by a cop who had only
recently graduated from the police academy. Just over a week before his
death, he posted that he doesn't want to die too young on Twitter.
Officers responded to a burglary call around 1 a.m. on Friday, hearing reports
that a suspect was damaging vehicles. First spotting Taylor moving about the
lot, officers also noticed Taylor's SUV had been smashed into the front of the
dealership showroom. Finding that Taylor had moved inside the showroom,
Arlington Police Chief Police Will Johnson said Taylor would not comply when
told to lie down on the ground, but fled to a back room. 49-year-old officer
Brad Miller entered the showroom to arrest Taylor, and then an altercation
broke out. Miller fired four shots, including the fatal bullets from the gun of
Miller. A second officer fired a taser, Johnson said.
And now there are three main points that you should think of:
1) Taylor was described as a good kid. He was a football player at Angelo
State University. Never was involved in criminal activities.
2) The officer graduated from the police academy less than 6 months ago and
was working under the supervision of a training officer.
3) Taylor didn't want to die young.
Black teens don't really live, they survive. And, unfortunately, there is no one
to save them from death. There is no one to stop police brutality. We all want
our kids to feel safe, we want them to be safe and sound. Are our hopes
doomed to disappointment?","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","- Living In: United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis

The weirdest thing about this specific case is that the suicide was committed
just an hour after the arrest. Moreover, the woman was suspected of stealing
someone's phone which is quite not a reason for getting to her account.
We've got to also take into consideration that 1 in 3 black men go to prison as
opposed to a considerably lower rate with the white men (http://www.alternet.

Hide Evidence
A police officer in Alabama proposed murdering a black resident and creating
bogus evidence to suggest the killing was in self-defense.
Officer Troy Middlebrooks kept his job and continues to patrol Alexander City
after authorities there paid the man $35,000 to avoid being publicly sued over
the incident. Middlebrooks, a veteran of the US marines, said the man ""needs
a god damn bullet"" and allegedly referred to him as ""that nigger"", after
becoming frustrated that the man was not punished more harshly over a prior
run-in.
The payment was made to the black resident, Vincent Bias, after a secret
recording of Middlebrooks's remarks was played to the city's police chiefs
and the mayor. Elected city councillors said they were not consulted.
Do you know that you can go to prison for murderous intent? However, if you
are a white police officer, offering to KILL a BLACK AMERICAN and then hide
the evidence, then you don't even get fired. Oh yeah, it's happening in a
wonderful state called Alabama! You know how it works here. Do you have

On Saturday there were two protests: a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina
and an anti-racism protest. About 2,000 people arrived to South Carolina's
statehouse. Some of them present the KKK's rally against the removal of the
Confederate flag, while others were from the New Black Panther party and
Black Lives matter groups, holding the Republic of New Afrika flag.
It is a very clear signal for the federal government that the protest obtains a
systematic and ideological basis. The Klan wanted to underline the traditional
heritage of the Confederate flag. Black protesters, on the contrary stand
against racism. There were also many anti-racism supporters of other races.
The main problem is hatred which is spread among our society. The
government does nothing to solve the matter. If America is a land of free, we
should clear our country of racism. But on the other hand we shouldn't refuse

fact a white man pretending to be black.

Throughout the twenty-first century there are thousands of complaints of the
police ""profiling"" black drivers in America. Black Americans often complaint
about being pulled over for the phenomenon called ""driving while black"". For
example, a rich African American driving new Ferrari can be stopped
hundreds of times for no apparent reason just because the fact that a black
man driving an expensive car attract the attention of the police officers.
But what if racial profiling ends with lethal consequences? Do you remember
Sandra Bland who had run-ins with the police while driving? Do you all
remember that she was found dead in police custody? Do we all have to
avoid traffic stops in order to survive?
For the matter of fact, the routine traffic stops are being a big deal for the
people of color. According to the Justice Department statistics, black drivers
are about 31 percent more likely to be subject to police than whites. Overall,
this number indicates the racial difference in America.","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","- Living In: United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis

The Boy Scouts of America Executive Committee unanimously approved
allowing gay adults to serve as leaders, officials said on Monday, in a major

This resolution will allow chartered organizations to select adult leaders

policy of chartered organizations selecting their leaders.

are still going to be groups that are going to be hostile to gay leaders ... This

to issue search warrant
On Wednesday, Aug. 19 racial tensions again sparked in Missouri city after
St. Louis police officers fatally shot black teenager at Walton Avenue and
Page Boulevard while trying to issue search warrant. According to St. Louis
Police Chief San Dotson, a young black man pointed a gun at officers and
was trying to escape from a house where officers were carrying out a search
warrant for him. The 33-year-old and 20-year-old officers who shot the
suspect four times were about seven years on the force.
That was followed by crowd of 150 people who gathered by intersection. Later
on, nine people were arrested on charges of resisting arrest. The protesters
said that the police provoked the situation. What do you think about it? What if
this situation makes us want to keep the police out of our neighborhood? Why
do you think police shoots first and then asks questions? Do you realize that
the shooting came just ten days after St. Louis was flooded with protesters
who were marking the anniversary of Michael Brown? What if the city and the
government needs to center its attention on racism and discrimination in
America instead of suspecting every single black men?

than we must do something about it. Protest or accept it. You choose. This is

Wedding cake is back in the news with developments in both the Oregon and
Colorado bakery cases involving discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation. In Oregon,judgment has been finalized against Sweet Cakes by
Melissa, requiring Aaron and Melissa Klein to pay a $135,000 fine for refusing
service to a same-sex couple. Meanwhile, in Colorado, Jack Phillips of
Masterpiece Cakeshop, is appealing the ruling against him for refusing to
serve a same-sex couple.
In the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges,
conservatives are eager to highlight Phillips and the Kleins as evidence that
religious freedom is under attack. In fact, they have actually invented a new
claim about how these bakers' ""free speech"" is under attack and how
they're thus the real victims.
There's a simple solution. Since they won't agree to the conditions for having
a license to do business with the public, they shouldn't have a license to do
business with the public! This is not a free speech issue, it is an issue of
American law! They can speak about their bigotry and ignorance, not to
practice it!","https://www.facebook.com/LGBT-United-839497472793277/","- Living In: United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

Parents are worried about their children's safety.
Yet here we are, Tennessee parents are worried about their children's safety
at the local school after discovering that anyone is permitted to wear
Confederate flag attire and to fly the Confederate flags at school. This
provoked widespread discontent among black parents of Rutherford County.
One of the parents said that she witnessed the students wearing the
Confederate flag T-shirt and the controversial flags flying in the back
students' cars.
How would you feel if your child studies among those who like to fly the
Confederate flags on their trucks? How would you feel about the safety of
your child? Why children were permitted to openly display the Confederate
flag on the school grounds? What kind of symbol the Confederate flag is for
you? Do you remember Dylann Roof who killed black people at church? Do
you remember that he was promoting the Confederate flag? What if your child
studies among the same people? Is it an appropriate place for your kid to
study?
If Nazi flag was banned, than the Confederate flag must be outlawed too.
Thus, if the government continues to accept this flag, it will bring more racist
and hateful movements, because the Confederate flag shows a lack of
empathy for African Americans slavery and for every black American man.","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","- Living In: United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis

The Vatican has rejected a request by a transgender man in Spain to become
a godparent, ruling that his sexual identity means he is incapable of carrying
out the task.
Alex Salinas was asked by his family to be godfather to his nephew, but the
bishop of his local diocese on Spain's southern coast questioned his gender
identity.
Salinas was born a woman but has since undergone hormone therapy and
has a male ID in Spain. He is now waiting for gender surgery.
Bishop Rafael Zornoza Boy of Cadiz and Ceuta rejected the family's request
to name Salinas as a godfather. Then, after a media storm, the bishop wrote
to the Vatican for advice.
Zornoza published the Vatican's reasoning for rejecting Salinas' wish.
It said transsexual behavior ""reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to
the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the
truth of one's own sexuality.""
The pope supported gays, but now for some reason the transman wasn't
allowed to be a godfather in Spain, an entirely Catholic, but at the same time,
the most friendly country towards the LGBT community. Anyway it's just
another superstition of Church. Funny.","https://www.facebook.com/LGBT-United-839497472793277/","United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

sex, but will not judge you for hating someone you have never met?
A Kentucky clerk who defied a federal judge's order to issue marriage
licenses and turned away four gay couples has until Monday to convince the
judge to delay his mandate.
U.S. District Judge David L. Bunning rejected Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis'
claim that her Christian faith should exempt her from issuing marriage
licenses to same-sex couples and ordered her on Wednesday to hand out the
licenses. But her office kept denying them.
Interesting what would happen if I walked up to my boss and said I refuse to
the job I am being paid for today? Let me think... guess I would stand in the
unemployment line!
Her job is not to participate in gay weddings!! All she has to do is confirm that
the paperwork is correct! She should be fired, fined and charged with

"416","Chicago Boy Amari Brown Among 3 Dead, 27 Injured In Just 8-Hour Span
In just an eight-hour span during the Fourth of July weekend, gun violence in
Chicago left three people dead and 27 wounded. Amari Brown, a 7-year-old
boy on the city's West Side, was the youngest of the fatalities.
Those 30 shootings came between 9:20 p.m Saturday and 4:45 a.m. Sunday.
Amari had spent the day celebrating with family and riding his scooter up and
down the block where he lived with his grandmother and several other
relatives in Humboldt Park. Just before midnight, a gunman opened fire
outside a relative's home where Amari and other children were playing, hitting
both the 7-year-old and a 26-year-old woman in the chest.
No arrests have been made. Family members will hold a press conference
Sunday afternoon to call for Amari's killer to turn himself in.
How can we feel safe here in America? Permanent threat to life follows every
American like a shadow. What did this boy do to deserve a bullet in his body?
He just played with his friends outdoor. Is human life really worth nothing in
our country?
Rest in peace, Amari Brown.","https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/","United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;

Stories like the one of Jamycheal Mitchell, the 24-year-old young man who
was found dead in his jail cell on August 19, are particularly hard to hear.
What the police ruled ""natural causes"" turned out to be that he starved to
death. The crime? Shoplifting. Mitchell. who had a severe mental illness had
been ruled permanently disabled and was unable to work. In April, he stole a
zebra cake. a Snickers, and Mountain Dew from a local 7-11 in Portsmouth;
Virginia. It would be a month before he ever went before a judge.
A judge then ruled him incompetent to stand trial. He should have been
transported to a local mental health facility, but he wasn't. Apparently there
wasn't one that had room for him. Three months later he was found dead in
his cell. No meds had ever been administered. He had never made it to a
mental health facility. He had lost nearly 80 pounds because he refused to
eat. All for less than $5 worth of snacks he stole while in a mental health
crisis.

The Supreme Court on Monday evening denied a Kentucky clerk's request to
keep enforcing her ""no marriage licenses"" policy — an attempt to avoid
issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples — while she appeals the trial
court's preliminary ruling.
Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis will have to choose whether to issue marriage
licenses, defying her Christian conviction, or continue to refuse them, defying
a federal judge who could pummel her with fines or order that she be hauled
off to jail.
For Ms. Davis to enact her own personal policy is completely unacceptable.
She is on her fourth marriage, a sinner according to her Bible, yet she's
screaming about religious convictions. What a hypocrite!
And she doesn't even perform the ceremony, only issue a license. What her
religious convictions has to do with it?? It's not up to her to make policy, it's
her role only to enact it!
Funny how all these ""Christians"" are preaching and practicing all this hate,
eh?
If Jesus were around today, his response would be most likely, ""What the hell
is wrong with you people!""

With Crutches in San Francisco
Writer Chaedria LaBouvier reported that she had seen 14 San Francisco
police officers subduing a homeless black man who had one leg outside
Twitter headquarters.
Witnesses told LaBouvier that police had been called because the man was
waving sticks,"" which later turned out to be his crutches.
None of the employees at Twitter or other tech companies came out to object
as the 14 officers took down the one-legged homeless man.
The U.S. Justice Department recently filed court documents in an Idaho case
which declared it unconstitutional to criminalize homelessness. According to
the Coalition on Homelessness, the city handed out 11,000 citations to
homeless people who were sitting on sidewalks between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m.
in 2014.

that justice is when all lives matter.
Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the
law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes
over the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the
immigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should
be imprisoned.
Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in
Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan's
benevolent intentions.
This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim
communities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent
news about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal
Robert O'Neill, the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden, and called on
American extremists to execute him.
There is no problem, if whoever wants to live in the United States. But he
should live here legally; he should not break the law. It's justice.","https://www.facebook.com/patriototus","United States: Washington

"14","This military campaign is very ambiguous given that it has cost nearly 2,500
American lives and hundreds of billions of dollars. The goal was to ""disrupt
the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations."" Well, the
intervention deprived al-Qaida of a sanctuary. But al-Qaida — even after its
leader Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. commandos — has spawned cells
elsewhere and inspired other extremists in Syria and Iraq. And now ISIS is
rising as the most powerful terrorist organisation in the world. So, the question
is whether it's worth to risk the lives of thousands of American soldiers for the
mission that hardly can be called successful? It seems that Obama should
review his military strategy without delay.Join us! Veterans USA( @veterans

was granted Americans by the Founding Fathers. However, liberals just spit
on the U.S. Constitution. So, Hillary Clinton said it's ""worth considering"" a
nationwide gun ban and a ""buyback"" program to eradicate private gun
ownership.
Hillary says she is a democrat. Huh! No, she like Obama should say they're
socialists who want to set up tyranny. The Founding Fathers had enough
brains for preventing the situation when dictators run the country. They
decided that armed nation is able to overthrow a tyrant. Maybe is it a true

On October 10, 2015 in Washington, D.C., at the National Mall, The
Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan will convene the 20th Anniversary of the
Million Man March under the theme: Justice or Else!
""The Million Man March was one of the most historic organizing and
mobilizing events in the history of Black people in the United States,"" said
Chicago-based Dr. Conrad Worrill, who was a main organizer of the March
and the current president emeritus of the National United Black Front.
The widespread death, rising racism, mob attacks and police brutality on
Blacks coupled with economic deprivation and stark poverty, requires that
something must be immediately done to address and correct the condition.
We should stop the violence and the killings and present ourselves as a
united front before the Government of the United States of America. Fredrick
Douglas said "" Power concedes nothing except by a demand"". Our demand
of government must be backed by the power of our unity and love of the
brotherhood.
It's really important for all of us, brothers and sisters.

I'm proud to be an American. But I reckon that I can't have the right to keep
silence when outrageous things happen.
I can't keep silence while stupid idiots forbid our children to wear patriotic
clothes. I can't keep silence while Obama creates comfortable conditions for
terrorists, accepting of 10,000 Syrian refugees. I can't keep silence while
liberals spit on the U.S. Constitution.
Yes, I criticize everything what is unacceptable for the nation. If Americans
turn a blind eye to outrageous things, enjoying only positive moments of their
lives, we will never live better. Criticism is a way for development. I'm a
patriot, that's why I criticize.","https://www.facebook.com/patriototus","- Living In: United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

"317","Mass Shooting At Umpqua Community College In Oregon, 10 Reported Dead
Ten people were killed and seven were wounded Thursday in a shooting at a
small community college in Roseburg, Oregon. The shooting took place in
classrooms in Snyder Hall.
Law enforcement officials have identified Chris Harper Mercer as the man
responsible for the mass shooting.He had four weapons on him - three
handguns and one assault weapon. Also he was definitely ready to put up a
fight, because he had body armor and stash of ammunition.
One of the witnesses said that the gunman first asked about people's
religions before he began firing.
The hospital said that all victims were female between the ages of 18 and 34,
and quoted a doctor who said that an ""army"" of doctors and nurses had
volunteered to help.
It's the 45th shooting at a school so far this year. Obama said that America is
the only country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few
months. And he's right. People already got used to this. Isn't it time for some
gun control yet?
Some white supremacists say that the killer was mixed and he supported
BLM. This information is not confirmed and is more likely to be fake. This
dude is definitely not black. His parents are Caucasian. The fact it's been a
few hours since the shooting and they haven't say what race he is means he's
white. And honestly, word ""shooting"" isn't used correctly here. Can we call it
terror? Oh, wait. White male though...

"316","Why I March! #JusticeOrElse
20 years ago. 20 years a million men, women and children gathered on the
National Mall in Washington, DC answering the call from Minister Louis
Farrakhan to come to the nation's capital and show our strength in numbers
and unity and remind politicians that our voices would be heard. 20 years
later, we return to call on our politicians to fix our broken criminal justice
system once and for all.
I march to fix a system that houses more black men in our prison system than
there were black men enslaved in 1850. To fix a system that allows for local
prosecutors to investigate their friends at the police department when there is
an officer-involved shooting. To fix a system that has drug laws that
disproportionately arrest black and brown people for using drugs when white
people use at the same rate. To fix a system that has built a private industry
off the backs of prisoners laboring for pennies. To fix a system that doesn't
video record the actions of law enforcement at all times. To fix a system that
criminalizes young women who are pimped and sexually trafficked before
they even turn 18. To fix a system that does not collect any national data on
incidents when police use excessive force or discharge their firearm. To fix a
system that has incarcerated more people than any other nation in the world.
To fix a system that has created a school to prison pipeline by harsher school
discipline practices for young students of color. To fix a system of policing that
targets communities of color by programs like ""Stop & Frisk"" or ""Broken
Windows.""
This is why I march. This is why we all should march in order to build a better
future for our kids. We should fight the institutional racism in the country.

"542","A heavily armed Syed Farook, his wife and brother opened fire on a holiday
banquet for his co-workers Wednesday, killing 14 people and seriously
wounding more than a dozen others in a precision assault. Hours later, two
terrorists died in a shootout with San Bernardino police. One shooter still at
large.
It is known that gunmen are Muslims. They are very religious and probably
linked with ISIS. California shooting should become a lesson for the
administration — accepting refugees from Syria threatens the National
security.
It's tragedy. Enemies of America attacked our people again. Unfortunately,
today we have no strong leader who is courageous enough to conquer
terrorism. Nevertheless, we will not allow terrorists to change our way of life.
We will not allow them to restrict our freedoms.

"905","There're a lot of racial discrimination going on in America these days. Can
you imagine that a group of armed men took over a federal property and have
vowed to kill if they are forced to leave there unless the government change
the law in their favor. Nonsense!
The ongoing Oregon standoff has taught us is that it's never been more
apparent that the U.S. government values white lives above all others. The
most stark example is comparing the kid-gloves treatment the white gunmen
in Oregon are getting with the 1985 bombing of the MOVE house in
Philadelphia.

"897","Robert Bentley, Alabama Governor, has decided to reform prison system.
This is actually good news? Alabama happens to be one of the nation's
poorest states which have led to overcrowd in its prison. The prison system
houses 24,000 inmates but it was designed for 13,000.Let me enlighten you a
little on how it's going to be done. Four other larger prisons will be built
additionally to prevent the rate of overcrowd. Even though one would have
taught of using this money for projects like health care facilities and other, he
chose prisons. It's not bad though, at least inmates will have free live behind
bars. It shows how much he cares for his people.

only do that by making the cops kill him. This is absolutely insane in the
highest order. He took a gun and ordered his other two brothers to take a
video of the whole incident. Michael Ford, at the police vicinity opened fire
and got the cop's attention. The filming was still in process as he
commanded. The first cops who appeared fired back and almost immediately
ended up drawing fire. He gave the other officer a chance to get into position
when he opened fire. It's quite not understandable why his own cop shot him
and shot the mentality ill man too. This is a good example of sick reality too. Is
there any explanation why cops have started shooting each other?

Through the struggles and pains of losing a dear husband. Nicole Bennett has
built courage to take maternity photos with her 4-year-old son. She added old
photos of late husband Deonta, but they were slightly faded to appear as a
spirit — a symbol of hope that he watches over them.
She also did this as a memorial for her unborn daughter who is due March 25.
We commend her for her boldness and we hope that she finds solace in these
photos.

pro-immigration policy. She also promised to offer illegals residency and ""a
path of citizenship"". During the debate on 8th March she was asked about
deportation.
Clinton said: ""I would not deport children. I do not want to deport family
members either. I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent
criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us. That's
a relatively small universe."" Oh wonderful, so she admits she wants to be the
second Obama, like the first one isn't enough. And we know what's behind
this world ""children"" — young men who claim to be less than 18. Same way
the ""illegals without a criminal record"" is also those who are not proved to be
criminals yet.
Crossing the U.S. border without permission is already a crime. A crime that
should bring just one simple punishment — deportation and a prohibition of
further entrance. We do not need a president who doesn't understand that.

"899","Last Saturday night. 68-year-old David Rice, also known as Mondo we Langa,
a former Black Panther passed away Nebraska prison.
In 1970, Rice was one of the two officers who were charged for the murder of
Omaha police officer, Larry Minard. Authorities claim they coaxed Larry to a
house with a 911 call, and then detonated a homemade bomb that killed him.
He was the seventh-longest-serving inmate in Nebraska.
Subsequent paroles and retrials were denied for these two men. Langa was in
prison for 45 years. Details of the cause of his death are still unknown.
Rest in peace, Mondo we Langa.

"826","It is so disheartening knowing that people are put behind bars because they
failed to settle a fine. Most people are jailed because one way or the other
there was no money to do what was necessary at a particular time even
though they were innocent. Prosecutors have developed this platform as a
gold mine, extracting huge sum of money from civilians. You can be put
behind bars if you fail to comply with the demands. Suddenly one's life
becomes tattered when jail comes in, because there is no freedom of making
a better living. Federal prosecutors should shake up and hold judges and all
these people who take advantages of people by making them pay huge sums
of money or put someone behind bars because he/she couldn't pay a fine.

"1327","Congressional Republicans voted on Thursday to make it more difficult for
refugees from Syria and Iraq to come to the US as the fallout from last
Friday's Isis terrorist attacks in Paris continues.
In addition, more than half of the US's governors have said they will no
longer provide placement for Syrian refugees, arguing that they pose too
great a risk to national security.
New Jersey governor and Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie
has said his state will not take in any refugees — ""not even orphans under the
age of five"".
Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal has said he has directed state police to
""track"" the Syrian refugees in his state, something his state police have
played down.
GOP presidential hopefuls Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush have suggested the US
government prioritize Christian refugees.
Barack Obama has pledged to veto the legislation, and has condemned the
anti-refugee comments as ""un-American"", but experts worry the backlash
could have dangerous consequences if these claims go unchecked.

""Sowing fear of refugees is exactly the kind of response groups like Isis are
seeking,"" said lain Levine, deputy executive director for program at Human
Rights Watch, on Thursday. ""Yes, governments need to bring order to
refugee processing and weed out militant extremists, but now more than ever
they also need to stand with people uprooted from their homes by ideologies
of hatred and help them find real protection.""

"782","Brendan Carter decided to pay a visit to his sick uncle and was held by
officers in a public RTS bus station in Rochester, New York. Carter said he
was at a station waiting for bus. Freeing himself from emotional trauma,
Carter decided to hip his soul with music, when he put his headphones on
and started to dance. Suddenly, officers approached him and began asking
him out of the premises. Apparently he had not committed any crime or
violated any order, so he was disturbed and begun to argue with them.
Seriously this guy was detained for useless reasons. This is what American
police find interest in — unnecessary and useless way of harassing blacks.
Very ridiculous.

"537","The liberal mass media tried to overblow a story about the KKK's
endorsement of Trump. They claimed Donald is supported by David Duke and
""white supremacists"". The journalists are trying to depict Trump as a racist
and continue their attempts even after Trump officially declared ""I don't know
anything about David Duke... You're asking me a question that I'm supposed
to be talking people I know nothing about.""
However, ""for some reasons"" the same mass media in their revelation
campaign forgot to mention Hillary Clinton's ties to Robert Byrd, a former
KKK leader. Hillary described him as a man of ""surpassing eloquence and
nobility"". In 2010 after Byrd died she released a tribute video saying ""It is
almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd.
He was not just its longest-serving member; he was its heart, its soul, and its
historian. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he
was always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless
advocacy for his West Virginia constituents, his fierce defense of the
Constitution, and the traditions of the Senate, and his passion for a
government that improves the lives of the people it serves.""
So here the mass media give us an political paradox: a Republican candidate
can't be endorsed by a former KKK member, but a Democrat can easily show
her respect and honor to a former racist leader without being judged for that.

"513","Patricia Smith, a mother of Benghazi arrack victim's made some statements
this Thursday broadcast on Fox Business Network. She said there is ""a
special place in hell"" for people like Hillary ""and I hope she enjoys it there"".
Smith added in her interview: ""I want Hillary to talk to me personally, and tell
me why there was no security there, when they were asked for it. I know this,
because I spoke to my son. That day, he says he was really scared, because
he saw the 17 people — 17 November, whatever it was, that they were walking
around taking pictures. And he was afraid. He says it didn't look very good.
And he was afraid. And that he asked for security, and he was turned down.""
This must be a mean joke we're having that kind of liar as a possible
president. Even understanding that most liberals are brainwashed I just don't
get it - how can a politician caught in a lie of that scale still be trusted by
electorate? One must be totally insane to follow THAT kind of leader.
Patricia's son is an American hero and his blood is on Hillary's hands.","https://www.facebook.com/patriototus/","- Living In: United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

Dear Mrs. Clinton,
We are trying not to be political, but the current presidential elections and the
rise of hate against Muslims made us realize that it is time to stand and let our
voices be heard.
We know that you defend American Muslims now in your presidential
campaign, but did you support us before campaign?
We didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq, we are Muslims and
Americans, so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused
hundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their
homes, and also millions of Iraqi Muslims, including innocent men, women
and children, to die in their homes, and for what?
Libya! You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill AI-
Gaddafi. You said in an interview: ""We came, we saw, he died"". Let's not
forget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security,
and that caused the death of the U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens
and U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and
CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were
also injured in the attacks.
You killed Saddam Hussein and AI-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the
countries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat
not only to the U.S. but the whole world!
You are supporting gun control, disarming the American citizens and at the
same time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders,
creating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq,
Afghanistan and Syria.
8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years
ago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it. You change
your views very fast. You speak as a democrat and act as a republican. Sorry,
but you can not be our representer, you can not be the president of the United
States.
Sincerely,
United Muslims of America","https://www.facebook.com/MuslimAmerica/","United States

highest order. He took a gun and ordered his other two brothers to take a
video of the whole incident. Michael Ford, at the police vicinity opened fire
and got the cop's attention. The filming was still in process as he
commanded. The first cops who appeared fired back and almost immediately
ended up drawing fire. He gave the other officer a chance to get into position
when he opened fire. It's quite not understandable why his own cop shot him
and shot the mentality ill man too. This is a good example of sick reality too. Is
there any explanation why cops have started shooting each other?

"1610","Religious leaders joined local organizations in rallying support for two men
who said they were attacked outside a convenience store this weekend in
what police are investigating as a possible hate crime.
Authorities are reviewing surveillance video of the reported attack, which
occurred shortly after 3 a.m. Saturday at the Kwik Shop at 4820 E. 21 st St.
That's just northeast of the Wichita State University campus.
One of the victims was Khondonkor Usama, Muslim 23, the second victim, is
a 19-year-old student who has chosen to remain anonymous.
They were getting gas and snacks at about 3 a.m. Saturday when they
noticed a man shouting at someone who had apparently asked him for gas
money.
When the suspect began using racial slurs against the man who asked him
for money, one of the students attempted to intervene.
The attacker then turned his wrath on the two students, stopping his
motorcycle in front of Usama's car and approaching Usama's friend, who
had gotten out of the car.
The suspect called his friend ""brown trash"" and told him he had to ""leave this
country,""
According to Usama's account, his friend responded: ""This is my country.
Who the hell are you to tell me to leave?""
The incident ""escalated really quick,"" with the suspect attempting to punch
his friend, Usama said. When he attempted to break up the fight, Usama said
he was assaulted and knocked down.
He called 911, and as he was on the phone the attacker rode circles around
the two students, chanting ""Trump! Trump! Trump!"" and screaming, ""We'll
make America great again! We'll throw you out of the wall!""","https://www.facebook.com/MuslimAmerica/","- Living In: United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

is well-known how libtards are eager to blame our forefathers for being racist.
Yet they always forget to underpin their empty words with facts. Not like all
these SJWs, let's refer to racial discrimination in the army of Union. A black
soldier was paid $10 a month with a $3 clothing fee taken out, while a white
soldier was paid $13 a month but was not forced to pay a clothing allowance.
Almost a twofold difference! How tolerant tho! And what was going on in the
""racist"" Confederate States Army? Every soldier was paid $11/month until
1864 regardless of his skin color. Click to Learn More! #southunited South

filing a counterclaim against the estate of Quintonio LeGrier on the grounds of
assault and emotional distress. This is how it looks like when A White Police

sympathizers gave him a sleepless night. If it was lawful to kill Quintonio
LeGrier because he was in abnormal state of mind according to the cops,
then we ask, how about the shooting of Bettie Jones? The story is always
rewritten and painted when it comes to dealing with race. Racial disparity and
segregation cannot be overlooked in America. There is too much level of
inhumanity. The cops still things it wasn't enough killing a mentally

That's a fact that US police officers are bad trained. Cops are programmed to
take innocent lives. Cops here in America play God. They believe they are
judge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law,
it is their job to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot
someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their
eyes.
It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the
difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will
get away with it.
In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand
that their job is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,
they understand that they are not the jury and this is not their job.

Waddington, New York when she was stopped for ""looking suspicious"" by

Cooke didn't commit any crime, that's why she wanted to leave, but officers
had the different plans. She was thrown to the ground by the male agent and
the female agent deployed the taser. After she screamed from the pain for
several seconds, she was handcuffed, while agents illegally opened her truck
and searched it. Of course, they found nothing. She spent over an hour in
handcuffs and then about 4 hours in the US customs Station in Ogdensburg
before she could go home.

issues after exposure to tainted water. And he's not the only one!
Approximately 30,000 Marine Reservists may have suffered the same kind of
exposure.
Where were the liberals shouting about ecological problems? Why do they
care about shutting down the coal industry to avoid mysterious unproved
global warming but they don't mind thousands of Americans drinking
poisoned water?
Neither the VA officials nor our military commanders helped our Marines and
now they just feel abandoned. Bob Miranda-Boulay said `I don't count' — that
is what our veterans feel. That is not an attitude they deserve.
""I wanted to make a difference,"" Boulay said. ""I love my country and I wanted
to do the right thing. I wanted to be a Marine."" That is a real shame our
veterans feel being betrayed by our country leaders.","https://www.facebook.com/Being-Patriotic-1601685693432389/","- Living In: United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

particularly the equal rights of voting. It started in North Carolina but it can
spread all over the country. Blacks are being deprived of general voting rights.
The U.S. District Judge, Thomas Schroeder, on Monday dismissed lawsuits
challenging changes to the state's election laws, declaring that the
challenges failed to show that it hindered voters of color from exercising their
voting rights. The North Carolina law which eliminated early voting, same
—day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting requires voters who go to
the polls to show an acceptable form of identification such as a driver's
license, passport or military ID. This is not a good sign as we watch the world
take the new turn for the worse now while doing nothing.

"867","President Barack Obama signed a bill Friday eliminating the offensive and
outdated descriptors, after the legislation passed unanimously in the House
and Senate earlier this month. Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) sponsored the bill,
which aimed to ""modernize"" two references to ""Orientals"" and ""Negros"" in
the U.S. Code that date to the 1970's. The words will be replaced with ""Asian
Americans"" and ""African Americans,"" respectively. ""The term `Oriental' has
no place in federal law and at long last this insulting and outdated term will be
gone for good,"" Meng said in a statement on Friday. Obama signed the bill
shortly before leaving for his trip to Vietnam and Japan, where he will become
the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima.

"1491","Horrifying video shows inmate being shocked three times with a stun gun
Recently released video shows the moment officers shot 24-year-old Brandon
Bethea with a stun gun as he was in a jail cell.
Jail officers said Bethea had threatened them and that's why he was hit with
a stun gun but I guess cops didn't know the camera was recording them.
FIVE OFFICERS stood over Bethea and just watching how Clark pulled the
trigger two more times. As usual, no charges were ever filed against the
officers involved in Bethea's death.
There is no doubt that Bethea was murdered. Have you noticed that it took 20
minutes passed by before another officer summoned a nurse and they
attempted to revive Bethea. All of bastard cops who were there should be in
prison for murder. America, it's not a black or white problem... but a blue one.","https://www.facebook.com/Dont-Shoot-1157233400960126/","United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

"1237","ANOTHER BLACK MAN MURDERED IN POLICE CUSTODY. THINGS
HAVE BEEN VERY SILENT ON HIS BEHALF
The 31-year-old black man died Feb. 20 at Fairfield Medical center after he
had a °medical episode' at the jail when deputies were moving Ariel J. Clark
from one cell to another. According to police reports; Ariel J. Clark, 31 was
too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest.
On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark; reporting
that Clark, who was driving his wife and two children from Buffulo to Texas,
was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark's wife said that a man and his
son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he
hadn't slept in five days. When the police arrived. Clark was arrested, taken
to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint chair for his
combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some
breathing difficulties and deputies started chest compression. But an hour
later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital.
An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail
inmate.
Now the question is whether the jail's standard operating procedures were
followed.
We would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after ""fighting"" with
the police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at
hospital. For now the only thing we know is that another black man died in
police custody.","https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/","- Living In: United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

"1961","Illegal immigrant invasion is going at full speed and drug cartels are their most
powerful weapon.
Recently a huge drug cartel operation was discovered in North Carolina. Over
the course of the investigation, authorities seized six pounds of crystal meth,
eight pounds of marijuana, 49.3 grams of heroin, four handguns and $2.5
million in cash, according to a press release. ""It would be safe to say that the
money would be taken back to Mexico, and that's where the source of the
cocaine was,"" special agent Tim Stone said.
This is good news, but sadly this operation is just one of the thousands, which
makes it just a slap on the wrist. Our traitor government does nothing to
prevent drug influx, but only trying to create the presence of an effort. The
most part of this poison comes through southern border, but it is still as
unprotected as it possibly can be and drug cartels are abusing it as much as
they can.
At the expense of our tax dollars and lives of our youth, our government
officials continue to make some kinds of vile deals with drug cartels to get
filthy rich and gain more control over weaken nation.
Only a huge wall with gun towers will stop this invasion. Trump is our only

"1492","SHOCKING!!! Cops can't stop using their blue privilege for illegal parking.
Could you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she
realized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face
is priceless.
The story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for
illegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver, who
had towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The
driver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under
threat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125.
The sheriff's office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11
years and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that
how PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix
the situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer
is to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not
have mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon.
To my mind, this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun.
Such cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give
our citizens a chance to get back home alive.

less than a month following the death of Felix Simoneaux Jr. on April 19.
Wish our veterans received more attention and care from our Government.
Obama's eight presidency years turned into a disaster to our veterans and

The family members of South Carolina church massacre victims are upset
with the distribution of donations the church has received since June
shooting. The Methodist Episcopal Church have decided that the families will
have to divide $1.5 million in donations, while they will keep $1.8 million; with
plans to make long-needed repairs to the church.
For instance, the wife of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney who was among those
killed by white shooter Dylan Roof, has not received any of the donation
proceeds.
Nothing will bring the victims of Charleston massacre back, but this money
will help aid in bridging the gap in the loss of an income. Donations are

"852","All people have to understand that the police service is exactly like a secret
gay club, the reason being that no one knows what goes on inside there even
if it's evident. There's a kind of code of silence, even if you saw something or
just know something about other police officer, you keep silence about it. But
if you are in a member of a club, you can be sure that no one will ever let your
secrets out. Statistically, 46% of cops admit to witnessing misconduct by other
cops! Also, 73 % of the individuals pressuring officers to keep quiet about the
misconduct are leaders. 8% of the officers who admitted to intentionally
withholding the information about officer misconduct were upper
administrators. Cops will always lie to suit interaction or conversation. Sadly
enough,""Sworn officer of the court"" is most likely to lie than the citizen he is
even accusing. So, the lie is a norm for the officers who are keeping the code
of silence, and it's a miracle if a police officer tells the truth.

allow them to break the law and lie about the circumstances which presented
them the opportunity to break the law.
?WARNING!!!? In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in
a public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense
altercation with a student.
According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim,
Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom.
The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a
brief clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him.
I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more
then a bunch of bullies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever
happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an
officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide
something and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also, is not
destruction of evidence a crime?

'TURNED THEM GAY'
Ruby Rose has recently shared her opinion on the people saying that she
""turned them gay"". She gets hundreds of flirty messages every day and she
laughs at the idea that changes someone's sexuality.
Roby Rose thinks that it's not possible to change someone's sexuality
because it's something you're born with and it's not changeable.
I agree with her! Unfortunately, bigots like to say that homosexuality is a
choice, so it can be ""cured"". Just like Ben Carson thinks that you're choosing
to be gay and the prison is the proof of that. These ideas lead to thousands of
broken lives.

DEPARTMENT FOR RACIAL DISCRIMINATION FACED THE SAME
ISSUED WHEN HE RETURNED TO WORK
Two Michigan Black police troopers who recently won lawsuit in racial
discrimination and were awarded $5.2 million are suing police department
again, claiming they faced the same issues.
According to State Police troopers Darzeil Hall and Lamarr Johnson, ever
since they returned to work; they have been subjected to petty attacks and
denied attempts in promotion.
Instead of correcting the wrong behavior toward black employees, police
department aggressively criticized their conduct. For instance, police trooper
Hall received a ""need improvement rating,"" his squad car was taken away,
and his gym car was deactivated for a minor mistake. Along with Hall,. police
trooper Johnson was denied at least five promotions after the lawsuit ended
on the basis of race.
Once again the race car is alive and well. Unfortunately; black police officers
still remain second-class officers and experience unfair treatment in police
department despite the fact that we live in a ""post-racial' society.","https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/","United States: Baltimore (+25 mi) Maryland","N/A","16 - 45","English (UK) or English (US)","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

executing orders of his bosses.
Obama was always a mere pawn in the hands of Arabian Sheikhs. His latest
orders are just proving it. All these refugees, which we are about to take in,
are soldiers with one simple goal. They are going to try to terrorize the nation
until it agrees to convert.
To win this war we need to gather our forces and elect a leader, who loves
America as much as we do and is willing to do everything it takes to protect it.

"1479","Everyday we watch, read and receive news of police beating, assaulting, and
killing innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common
that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were
wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,
karma's coming back for blue pigs!
A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police
officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two
officers for seemingly no reason.
The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two
school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza
shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of
police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally
nothing without using their guns.
Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their
own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and
electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing their job."" All those things and
more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my
rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.
Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine
about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is
why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our
ancestors did it for centuries.
Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will change. Amen.","https://www.facebook.com/Dont-Shoot-1157233400960126/","United States

The man who was accused of Da Vinci apartment complex arson that caused
the city $100 million in damages testified that he was angry at high-profile
killing of black men.
Dawud Abdulwali attended a party in a Hollywood hotel where he ranted
about the August 2014 killing of unarmed Michael Brown by a white police
officer in Ferguson. According to one of the witnesses; he was so mad about
the high profile killing of unarmed black men, so he burned the building.
Abdulwalia's anger at police was not a good reason to burn down some
apartments, but injustice brought him to this action. Either way, crime should
not be tolerated. But we have to start thinking about the message he was
trying to send: having a black president changes almost nothing.","https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/","United States: Baltimore (+25 mi) Maryland","N/A","16 - 45","English (UK) or English (US)","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

3rd federal court case seeks to block Mississippi LGBT law
A diverse group of gay, straight and transgender people have filed the third
federal court challenge seeking to block a Mississippi law that lets clerks cite
religious beliefs to recuse themselves from issuing marriage licenses to same-
sex couples. The lawsuit filed Friday says House Bill 1523 violates the
separation of church and state by favoring ""certain narrow religious beliefs
that condemn same-sex couples who get married, condemn unmarried
people who have sexual relations and condemn transgender people.""
How many times do we have to do this? Your BELIEFS don't supersede my

"1642","Muhammad Ali, the greatest boxer this world has ever known, is no more.
The fact that he is gone is difficult to come to terms with; for years, Ali was
renowned as a larger than life figure, the greatest, as he called himself, and
the demise of a man of such a high stature is surely a void that can never be
filled.
In the world of sports, Muhammad Ali will forever be known as the boxing
legend who won 56 bouts over the period of a 21-year career. In popular
culture, he will be remembered as the man who was not afraid when it came
to speaking his mind -- someone who was not shy of talking about things
unrelated to boxing, and would always take the right stand when needed.
He risked his career and reputation by opposing the US-Vietnam War.
Furthermore, he refused to serve in the US Army and in the process, was
accused of committing a felony.
Now that he is gone, this world is left with memories, and a void that cannot
be filled. May Allah rest his soul in peace and paradise!!!","https://www.facebook.com/United-Muslims-of-America-1479936895656747/","United States: Washington (+50 mi) District of Columbia","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

"1495","Please take a moment to read my story!
Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of
his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the
ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the
location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on
the passenger's side.
When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the
situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man
briefly lying unconscious on the ground.
The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows
that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?
Damn, after all that, the only thing I may conclude is DO NOT TALK TO
POLICE! The following video is a prime example of why...","https://www.facebook.com/Dont-Shoot-1157233400960126/","United States

Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of
his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the
ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the
location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on
the passenger's side.
When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the
situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man
briefly lying unconscious on the ground.
The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows
that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?

Reports indicate that he has just put forth a $1.3 billion budget proposal, to be

higher than what the government gives to Social Security Retirees. According
to a report from the Center for Immigration Studies, the average annual SSA
retirement benefit for legal citizens is roughly $14,772.
As if that weren't enough, the proposal also demands another $2.1 billion for
refugees.

citizens, but has no problem taking their hard earned money just give it to

happened the night a Chicago.
The video shows how officers, Michelle Morsi-Murphy and Jose Lopez,

Murphy jumped out of the car and approached her yelling curse words and
demanding she move the vehicle back. When Brown reached for her license;
Lopez pointed a gun at her head. Moreover, Lopez WAS LAUGHTING at poor

victim, her kids had suffered from pepper spray too.
The US police is just insane. What's the problem with peaceful arrest? Why
the hell they treat us as animals? This will not stop until cops are held
personally and financially responsible for their actions.
Could you imagine, if soldiers acted like this towards civilians in a combat
zone? 100% it would be treated as a war crime. So why do we have another
attitude to people in blue?","https://www.facebook.com/Dont-Shoot-1157233400960126/","United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

it's not enough for a man who was choked; tased, punched in the face several
times while the dog bit you? It should be more zeroes in the number.

"2420","""If you ask me about the Clinton Foundation, do I have a problem when a
sitting secretary of state and a foundation run by her husband collects many
millions of dollars from foreign governments, many governments which are
dictatorships... yeah, I do,"" Sanders said in an interview with Jake Tapper on
CNN.
So, Bernie has the point. I appreciate the way he maintains his independent
opinion in spite of all the pressure that is on him as the ""second Democratic
option"". Because that is a fact. The Clinton Foundation is nothing more than
an ""organized crime"" at it's finest, in which we are investing our taxpayers'
money!
Hillary has no problem in accepting foreign money from the countries, like
Saudi Arabia. Hillary has no remorse about taking money from countries that
abuse the rights of women, while she has always had her own alleged
feminist stance. She does not refrain from receiving money from the countries
that prosecute, torture and execute LGBT on the legal basis, although Hillary
has always been a ""defender"" of the minorities.
So, why are so many people going to vote for her? That's a secret for me.

This is one of the videos that authorities have released. Though the video is a
clear example of an excessive force, the report said that police officer had to
use his baton to protect himself.
Another cop was caught lying about the case. It's not the first video that
proves that cops are lying bastards and it's not the last. What they do is
systematically abusing people and then covering it with ""I was feared for my

societies. The school climate has a direct impact on both how well students
learn and how well they interact with other people. More and more teachers
today understand the importance of socialization and try to make their classes
more friendly where each student feels involved. But despite these efforts,
students who are LGBT continue to face a harsh reality....
May 24,25 Westboro baptist church is planning to stand against tolerance in
education system near LGBT-friendly Lawrence High School. They want to
""remind this nation that the parents, students, teachers and staff of the high
schools celebrate disobedience to God's law."" They are just inciting hate riots
and violence! Their right to protest infringes on others rights! Personally
have had enough of those idiots. Someone should picket them (in return)!!

May 16 marked the sixth anniversary of the brutal slaying of 7-year-old Aiyana

cop while she slept on a couch during a botched raid. The killer is still
employed by the Detroit Police Department. He was charged with involuntary
manslaughter and two lesser charges in her death, but the case was dropped
in January 2015.
Justice hasn't been served for Aiyana and her grieving family.
We're planning a peaceful rally in front of the Coleman A. Young Municipal
Center on May 21 to honor the memory of Aiyana and other victims of police
violence and demand demilitarization of police. We should draw as much

call herself a Democrat, her anti-American ambitions are more likely to look
like socialism and tyranny, not even close to Democracy.

"1105","On October 15, 1966, Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton have founded BPP.
Their idea was simple - we can't just talk to make the change, we must take
action. They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and challenge
police brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the
government and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party
""the greatest threat to the internal security of the country"". They tried to close
it, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was
dissolved.
50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country
stills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. It spreads through all the country
like the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We
need a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that
can make Black Lives really matter.
Let's get together and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the party that has
made the change. Let's honor its founders and participants. Let's share their
ideas and ideals! Black Panther Party 50th Anniversary","https://www.facebook.com/events/1094784283992152/","United States: Cleveland (+34 mi) Ohio","N/A","16 - 45","English (UK)or English (US)","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

sitting secretary of state and a foundation run by her husband collects many
millions of dollars from foreign governments, many governments which are
dictatorships... yeah, I do,"" Sanders said in an interview with Jake Tapper on
CNN.
So, Bernie has the point. I appreciate the way he maintains his independent
opinion in spite of all the pressure that is on him as the ""second Democratic
option"". Because that is a fact. The Clinton Foundation is nothing more than
an ""organized crime"" at it's finest, in which we are investing our taxpayers'
money!
Hillary has no problem in accepting foreign money from the countries, like
Saudi Arabia. Hillary has no remorse about taking money from countries that
abuse the rights of women, while she has always had her own alleged
feminist stance. She does not refrain from receiving money from the countries
that prosecute, torture and execute LGBT on the legal basis, although Hillary
has always been a ""defender"" of the minorities.
So, why are so many people going to vote for her? That's a secret for me.

Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of
his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the
ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the
location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on
the passenger's side.
When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the
situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man
briefly lying unconscious on the ground.
The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows
that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?
Damn, after all that, the only thing I may conclude is DO NOT TALK TO
POLICE! The following video is a prime example of why...","https://www.facebook.com/Dont-Shoot-1157233400960126/","United States: Louisiana","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

fatally shooting a mentally ill Black man in 2014 has gotten his job back? This
is a real proof that white officers will just kill blacks and still walk without
prosecution. This is the reason why they are not scared of taking a black
person's life. Fortunately he has lost an appeal to get his job back — for the
second time, but what I find really interesting is the reason why he was fired.
It is now absolutely clear that Police Chief fired Manney for his actions that led
to the shooting, but not for the shooting itself.

"860","Black people have no place in the coming 2016 presidential election because
we have had our chance and we never profited out of it. We had a moment to
present economic or social advancement plans to president Obama, yet we
refused and let anti- blacks trick us into thinking that was not elected to
benefit just black people alone. President Obama was elected for a reason.
He was the stepping stone for blacks to rise but it was blown away. Now, it is
the time of White America to rebuild and advance and make their race great.
The war for power between blacks and whites is very real, but the black
community has forgotten. Consequently, the power of black is fading day by
day because those in position are descending from the ladder every day. In
no time; ""White Power' will be stronger than before.

happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an
officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide
something and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also, is not
destruction of evidence a crime?

The attacker, Gerald Duane Lewis, 26, and his wife reportedly are members
of the Israel United in Church, which the Southern Poverty Law Center listed
as a hate group last year. According to the newspapers, Lewis was wearing a

"834","A lone sniper shot 14 people and killed 5 police officers, in Dallas late
Thursday night. It was a peaceful protest against the police shootings of Alton
Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights,
Minnesota. So he turned this peaceful protest into a scene of chaos and
carnage. The wounded include seven police officers and two civilians. The
sniper, Micah X. Johnson was a black U.S. military veteran of the Afghan war.
As he was captured, he claimed he wanted to ""kill white people"".
There's no evidence that he was a Black Lives Matters activist. There's no
proof that he was into the movement anyhow. It happened almost a week ago
and the police can't show anything to prove there was a link between Micah
X. Johnson and Black Lives matter. But the Main stream media are telling us
time and again that «black lives matter terrorists are killing the police officers».
The main stream Media are telling us, that the protest against police terror is
a violent anti-government riot!

"1480","Everyday we watch, read and receive news of police beating, assaulting, and
killing innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common
that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were
wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,
karma's coming back for blue pigs!
A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police
officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two
officers for seemingly no reason.
The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two
school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza
shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of
police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally
nothing without using their guns.
Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their
own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and
electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing their job."" All those things and
more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my
rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.
Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine
about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is
why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our
ancestors did it for centuries.
Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will change. Amen.","https://www.facebook.com/Dont-Shoot-1157233400960126/","United States: Louisiana","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

"445","We must ensure the Dallas attack on police will never happen again. Most
problems we face happen because we've stopped calling things by their
names and the assassination of cops in Dallas was no exception. We're
hiding behind political correctness and denying the truth because we don't
want to `offend' someone.
And the truth is: a group of people calling their supporters to commit violence
is not a peaceful group. A group of people coming to their opponent's rallies
and attacking peaceful people is a group of extremists. A group of people
standing behind the attack on police is a group of terrorists. The Black Lives
Matter are terrorists, and the sooner we admit it officially — the sooner this war
on cops will end and people running a conservative rally won't be afraid to be
attacked by a hateful gang.

"809","A demonstration which was held on Tuesday in response to the recent fatal
police shooting of Philando Castile resulted in the arrest of 46 people outside
the governor's mansion in St. Paul, Minnesota. Another arrest was carried
out the following day, during the morning hours where 23 protestors were
arrested and charged with public nuisance and unlawful assembly. Since July
7, the day after which Castile was fatally shot to death, sympathizers have
been embarking on demonstration outside the governor's home but police
officers are asking the protesters out of the premises because they are
blocking the streets. This request seemed not successful, therefore the
protesters stood against the officers. According to the governor, the protestors
are welcomed to stay because he had no problem with them being there.
Even though the street was cleared few days after July 18, some protesters
have returned to the premises to continue the demonstration.

around the nation have mobilized every year since 1996 for a National Day of
Protest to Stop Police Brutality, Repression and the Criminalization of a

Here in Charlotte, this problem appears especially hard. A number of victims
and quantity of cases, where justice wasn't served - horrifies. The most well-
known case is shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed black man who was
shot ten times and killed. Or situation with Daniel Kevin Harris, a deaf man,
who just couldn't explain a thing, before he was shot.
We need to use our right to protest to demand the authorities and police
representatives, to do, the thing they are supposed to do! To protect and
serve! Not to kill, damage and cripple!

"1569","What's the difference between USA cops and EU cops?
That's a fact that US police officers are bad trained. Cops are programmed to
take innocent lives. Cops here in America play God. They believe they are
judge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law,
it is their job to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot
someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their
eyes.
It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the
difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will
get away with it.
In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand
that their job is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,
they understand that they are not the jury and this is not their job.

Their idea was simple - we can't just talk to make the change, we must take
action. They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and challenge
police brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the
government and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party
""the greatest threat to the internal security of the country"". They tried to close
it, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was
dissolved.
50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country
stills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. It spreads through all the country
like the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We
need a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that
can make Black Lives really matter.

Killer cops involved in the shooting won't face discipline. Chief Janee Harteau

Of course, many of you will scoff at comparing 49ers quarterback Colin
Kaepernick to Martin Luther King Jr., who also demanded better from America
in 1966. But after all, Kaepernick is a great athlete who not just sat out the
national anthem in protest, but also gave back to the community by donating
to the Black Youth Project 100.
Kaepernick donated to the Chicago chapter of the organization toward
""Chapter-specific ideas and endeavors centered on advancing Agenda to
Build Black Futures"" which is dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all
Black people in order to improve the lives of black people in the United States
of America.
""I'll continue to look at other communities in Chicago, as well, as far as what

We all say it's a whiteman's world in the U.S. with white-favouring-rules and
everything, right?
So what makes you want to be a part of this system. in other terms, be a
slave to this system?
Why in the heck would you all be routing and rioting and fighting over and for
a two-party government system that cares less about you?
Damn; we all agreed with Kaepernick when he took the knee for us all, and
now we all, outta fear join white democrats to riot Trump?
Like wtf happened to we rising above the government system to improve our
lives and not joining this whole racist bias system?
Damn, that's sad:

around the nation have mobilized every year since 1996 for a National Day of
Protest to Stop Police Brutality, Repression and the Criminalization of a
Generation.
Here in Charlotte, this problem appears especially hard. A number of victims
and quantity of cases, where justice wasn't served - horrifies. The most well-
known case is shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed black man who was
shot ten times and killed. Or situation with Daniel Kevin Harris, a deaf man,
who just couldn't explain a thing, before he was shot.
We need to use our right to protest to demand the authorities and police
representatives, to do, the thing they are supposed to do! To protect and
serve! Not to kill, damage and cripple!

"2790","HILLARY CLINTON CHEATS AMERICAN VETERANS
The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans' issues was
in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans' life
improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are
some real Clinton decisions:
—Last year, Clinton claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had
been exaggerated by Republicans.
—In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007
supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans'
medical care.
-In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20
million for veterans' health care facilities.
-In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for 113 billion
for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.""
In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the
poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the
issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they
need so bad!
Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a
direct threat to the American veterans' society, but still practically no one
raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!","https://www.facebook.comNeterans-Come-First-1757336424535312/","- Living In: United States

The study showed that Caucasians earning less than $25,000 per year were
likely to have better credit scores than African-Americans earning between
$65,000 and $75,000 per year.
Overall, the study found 27 percent of all credit reports belonging to
Caucasians were poor, compared to 48 percent of those belonging to African-

researchers said the system may be inherently stacked against minorities.

STRUGGLED WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER
Michelle Lee Shirley was fatally shot by Torrance police officer as she
approached a group of police officers in her car.
Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were
warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley,
who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars.
When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at
her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting.
After the shooting, Shirley was taken to County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center
and was pronounced dead.
Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to
balance motherhood and law school. In a video titled, ""It's Up to Us,"" she
was asking people to take seriously a mental disorder and seek help because
ignoring it can take away years of people's lives.
Did you know that people with mental illness are 16 times more likely to be
killed during a police encounter than mental healthy? Did you know that half
of people shot by cops are mentally ill?
Police officers are not equipped with firearms to deal with mental illness in the
field. But they are equipped to protect us from criminals.","https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/","United States

What does that mean? Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But
enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always
was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be
followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need
of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would
be exposed to, and of their need of protection.

aggressive types. Oh, and let's not forget gentrifiers. Or, as I like to call them,
""white migrators."" Apparently, instead of knocking on a neighbor's door,
people take the easy and passive-aggressive way out and just leave notes
instead. But one man wasn't having it.

"3157","Joshua was born in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in Indianapolis. Two months
before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two
sons.
Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of
his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in
Indianapolis at the age of 26.
Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what
authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off-
duty firefighter.
The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest
Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said.
Suddenly, Boxley said, a car cut her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old
sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her
off — who she believed was a Chicago police officer — stopped and got out of
their cars.
At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a
gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley.
She said the man got inside his car but exited again and ""he just started
shooting,"" hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his
gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal
legally owned the gun and did not fire it.
Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began
shooting him.
""I was hoping my brother wasn't dead,"" said Boxley.
Beal's mother said he was a father to two children, a 4-year-old and a 2-year-
old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother.
""This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They
have no consideration for life,"" - Tiffaney Boxley.
Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will
say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own
death, armed or unarmed.

If you exclusively date outside of your ethnicity and culture, you hate yourself.
Don't talk to me until you start to love yourself.
I'm going to get many people complaining about this post... I don't care. If you
won't check for your own people, seek help not more approval.
I'm not saying you should ever check for people outside of your culture, I am
saying brothers if every women you have ever been with, isn't from your
culture/ethnic group, you have issues of the mind. You are doing this not by
love but on purpose, because you hate yourself subconsciously, it's ok, just
love yourself and heal your illness. ?

Clinton, all just to make sure Trump doesn't become president.

unacceptable for us to see them ruin all we've been building for decades. For
centuries. The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but
they are wrong. We won't put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does
not talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it
mention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some
outdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a
victory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no.
We are free citizens of Texas and we've had enough of this cheap show on
the screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and
gun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but
not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher
taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist
attacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let's remind them
what Texas is made of and show that we're ready to SECEDE!

into a nightmare for this black man.
Kevin Campbell was driving his wife's minivan home in June when he was
targeted for revenue collection by Allen Park Police Officer Daniel Mack.
Mack literally kidnapped Campbell, placed him in handcuffs, threw him in a
cage over a suspended license, accused Campbell of having drugs on him
despite the fact that the K9 didn't find anything. Moreover, the cop sodomized
him by putting the illegal substance inside his body. There was no search

Nobody knows the color of his skin, nobody has ever seen him, but white
supremacists go crazy if they see a black Santa.
That's always making me laugh.
I would advice white racists to love the snow for its whiteness and to hate the
coil for its blackness.
No matter that the snow is killing you and the coil gives you the heat to
survive.

"3231","Meet Joseph Wicks, the man whose biggest dream is to save old house in
downtown Charleston.
Joseph, a retired Pittsburgh firefighter, is moving an old house on Woolfe
Street that's being displaced by development says he's doing it to make a
statement.
""It was something that I really wanted to go into because it was something
that's not done here by black folk. said Joseph Wicks; who now owns the
house at 33 Woolfe St. `None of the historic revitalization is ever targeted
toward black folk.""
Wicks says he has seen Blacks moved out of downtown neighborhoods
because the development of the tourism in this area caused the increasing of
home prices and made taxes unaffordable for most.
The reason why Wicks bought this house is that it was built in 1840 and it
cant be torn down!
I'm so proud of this man! He is making a real movement! Actions like this can
protect our history!","https://www.facebook.com/Black4BIack-1268698556482143/","- Living In: United States

unacceptable for us to see them ruin all we've been building for decades. For
centuries. The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but
they are wrong. We won't put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does
not talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it
mention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some
outdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a
victory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no.
We are free citizens of Texas and we've had enough of this cheap show on
the screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and
gun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but
not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher
taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist
attacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let's remind them
what Texas is made of and show that we're ready to SECEDE!

"726","Fellow Texans! It's time to say a strong NO to the establishment robbers. It is
unacceptable for us to see them ruin all we've been building for decades. For
centuries. The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but
they are wrong. We won't put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does
not talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it
mention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some
outdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a
victory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no.
We are free citizens of Texas and we've had enough of this cheap show on
the screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and
gun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but
not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher
taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist
attacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let's remind them
what Texas is made of and show that we're ready to SECEDE!
Use our page to team up with other locals. Invite your friends and family,
spread the word and let's make this effort together! Get Ready to Secede!","https://www.facebook.com/events/1828560880690663/","- Living In: United States: Abilene (+30 mi), Amarillo (+30 mi), Austin

"942","VIDEO: TEXAS SCHOOL TEACHER FIRED AFTER MANHANDLING
LITTLE BLACK BOY
The shocking video shows a Central Texas child trying to get up from a bean
bag chair in his classroom, while a Snook Independent School District
employee, Troy Vann pushing him repeatedly into it and mocking him again
and again.
After the concerned parent posted a disturbing video showing teacher
manhandling a small child on Facebook, the video went viral and it was
shared thousands of times.
In the video footage, Vann also tells the boy: ""Tell me no. When I tell you to
do something, you do it, boy.""
After the Burleson County Sheriff's Office launched an investigation, a
""behavior specialist"" who acted in an inappropriate manner with a young
student was fired.
The school district should provide a safe and secure environment for the
students. And the school should not condone or tolerate the employees who
abuse any child. The teachers who use excessive force against any child
should be removed immediately from the classroom and placed on
administrative leave. Otherwise, this will continue to happen.","https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/","United States

"2789","HILLARY CLINTON CHEATS AMERICAN VETERANS
The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans' issues was
in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans' life
improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are
some real Clinton decisions:
—Last year, Clinton claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had
been exaggerated by Republicans.
—In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007
supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans'
medical care.
-In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20
million for veterans' health care facilities.
-In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for 113 billion
for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.""
In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the
poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the
issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they
need so bad!
Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a
direct threat to the American veterans' society, but still practically no one
raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!","https://www.facebook.comNeterans-Come-First-1757336424535312/","- Living In: Turkmenistan","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

businesses that are the backbone of our neighborhoods and communities.
Often times, we overlook our own businesses to purchase products and
services from businesses outside of our communities. Many of us have heard
the disturbing statistic about a dollar circulating within the black community for
only 6 hours compared to approximately 2-4 weeks in white, Jewish, and
Asian communities. If we don't support our entrepreneurs, how can we
expect others to support our amazing businesses? We must continue to

"433","Boston police shot and killed a man wearing body armor and wielding an
assault rifle who critically injured two officers responding to a domestic
disturbance call late Wednesday, according to Police Commissioner William
Evans.
A gun battle raged at an East Boston home as a suspect, Kirk Figueroa, 33,
of East Boston, critically injured two Boston police officers late on October
12.He was then shot and killed by other officers who ran into the home to
drag out their wounded colleagues while undergoing heavy gunfire
themselves.
This bloody massacre is a vivid example of the fact that the war with police is
too far from being OVER. It's only coming and the consequences will be
destructive if Hillary Clinton, the main hardliner against cops, will become the
President of the United States.
Defending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of
every American Patriot. Recent spate of cop killings indicates that American
national identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments
liberal elites are constantly setting up on the country.
Democrats are unable to secure the police from attacks of extremist
movements like Black Lives Matter. The Nation must unite against reverse
racism, against those who want to destroy America!
Among all the candidates Donald Trump is the one and only who can defend
the police from terrorists.","https://www.facebook.com/Being-Patriotic-1601685693432389/","United States

in the stomach.
This photo of Ohio State fans mocking Flint water crisis with sign isn't at all
funny in any way and they should be ashamed of themselves.
I know it might sound 'racist,' but these white people are heartless!

"3284","Prior to cooking delicious five-star cuisine, celebrity chef Jeff Henderson
cooked something else entirely dangerous—cocaine. As a teenager,
Henderson manufactured and sold drugs in his native home in Los Angeles.
By 19, he was already earning US $35,000 per week. Henderson was later
apprehended and imprisoned for 10 years after one of his men was caught
carrying a big shipment. It was in prison that he discovered his natural flair for
cooking, while he was on kitchen duty.
He was released early for good behavior and soon started working for some
of LA's top restaurants before venturing into Las Vegas. After experiencing
many rejections due to his felonious past, Henderson finally managed to land
a job at Caesar's Palace. It was only a matter of time before he finally started
getting recognition and awards, including best Las Vegas Chef in 2001. All
the fame and success hasn't gotten to Henderson's head though and he has
continued to share his experiences with at-risk youth to show what they can
achieve in life with the right choices.","https://www.facebook.com/Hell_and_Back-1806743482876111/","- Living In: United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

What does that mean? Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But
enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always
was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be
followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need
of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would
be exposed to, and of their need of protection.
And we, American Christians, should remember about it. Sometimes you
have to arm yourself to protect your loved ones and friends.","https://www.facebook.com/Army-of-Jesus-I195795607160174/","- Living In: United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

deepening political divisions in the country, King's words and philosophy are
perhaps more critical for us today than at any point in the recent past.
We're coming together on January 15 to celebrate the life and achievements
one of the most influential American civil rights leaders. Don't forget to bring
your children with you, because it's important for them to know where they
come from and their rich history.
Join us on January 15! Let's keep the dream alive! Martin Luther King Jr.

at the train station.
According to a witness, the man who was arrested had originally been driving
across the light rail tracks, when officers on foot attempted to stop his car, at
which point, he drove off.
He added that the man ""wasn't resisting at all until they tased him""
After tasing the man police officers used their elbows and fists, as the man lay
on the ground, screaming for help.
The man was heard screaming in pain: ""My fucking back is killing me! Oh
god! My back!""
In a statement, released on November 2, Minneapolis Police Department
confirmed the arrest, but said that a fuller video would show that the officers'
conduct was justified.","https://www.facebook.com/Watch-the-Police-1095374457243609/","- Living In: United States

"1107","On October 15, 1966, Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton have founded BPP.
Their idea was simple - we can't just talk to make the change, we must take
action. They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and challenge
police brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the
government and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party
""the greatest threat to the internal security of the country"". They tried to close
it, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was
dissolved.
50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country
stills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. It spreads through all the country
like the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We
need a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that
can make Black Lives really matter.
Let's get together and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the party that has
made the change. Let's honor its founders and participants. Let's share their
ideas and ideals! Black Panther Party 50th Anniversary","https://www.facebook.com/events/I094784283992152/","United States: Houston (+50 mi) Texas","N/A","16 - 65+","English (UK)or English (US)","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

12-year-old was carrying a toy airsoft gun when officer Timothy Loehmann
shot him within two seconds of arriving on the scene. A grand jury decided not
indict the killer.
Tamir's mother said she is ""mad as hell"" with the grand jury's decision of
declaring the officer not guilty. She went on to say,""He was my bright and
shining star. He was full of light and laughter. Tamir had the potential to
become anything in the World, but Officer Loehmann and Garmback didn't
give him a chance"".

DROP CHARGES, CITING DOUBLE RISK
North Charleston police officer Michael Slager, who shot and killed 50-year-
old Scott after an April 2015 traffic stop, and his attorneys urged the court to
drop murder charge due to the double jeopardy that Slager faced before the
shooting. According to ex-cop's attorneys, their defendant acted in self-
defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times,
hitting Scott five times from behind.
Slager's defense attorney's:
""The double-teaming of Slager ... is a chilling example of how far politically
motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather
their own nests at the expense of a public servant ... who had to make a split-
second life or death decision that will be second-guessed by comfortable
armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.'
The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken
brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager's
dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him
about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott
jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a
bystander's video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire.
We've seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead
black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none
of them found guilty. That's why today it's important to send a message to
other police officers that if they do this, it's harsh penalty to pay.","https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/","United States

shot by two Minneapolis cops. According to witnesses. Jamar was handcuffed
when he was shot.
Killer cops involved in the shooting won't face discipline. Chief Janee Harteau
recently said that an internal investigation found the officers were warranted in
using deadly force in the death of the 24-year-old black man.
It's been a year since he died. Justice still hasn't been served.

Manville spent three years and four months in the slammer for manslaughter.
Manville continued to study while incarcerated and eventually earned two
college degrees during his sentence. He became enamored with the legal
profession and went to law school right after his parole.
He finally passed the bar exams in Michigan and Washington, DC after
waiting many years to be approved by the respective boards. Afterwards,
Manville worked tirelessly to improve the prison system and represented
various inmates and prison guards in civil cases. Nowadays, Manville teaches
law at Michigan State University, where he hopes the insights he shares with
students inspire them to someday help improve the system as well.

era portrait
Apparently, the man's main goal was to destroy the portrait of former Texas
Governor Fletcher Stockdale. The man was arrested right in the Capitol and
charged with felony burglary and criminal mischief.
It is not clear for now if his actions were inspired by the hatred towards
Confederate symbols or namely towards Governor Stockdale.
Nevertheless, this incident perfectly illustrates how liberal propaganda
influences even on Southern people.
The names of dignified Southern politicians and warriors should not be
blurred out by Washington. These people played a huge role in American
history; they fought for their beliefs and earned people's respect.
It is absolutely unpatriotic now to demonize their names! We should protect
our history and fight against liberal brainwashing.","https://www.facebook.com/South-United-1777037362551238/","- Living In: United States

in Native American fight for their rights. People have always tried to destroy
things they don't understand. And white people never understood native
culture properly. Many teens who had native ancestors deep in the past know

"2461","""First and foremost, we as Chicago Public School students would like to thank
you for the supportive donation to our schools. As we all know, CPS has been
struggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to
where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the
community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to
improve our Chicago...
All of the things that you do for our city never go unnoticed. All of the free
concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the city really show you
care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility
away from artists, but it hasn't changed you...
We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others
have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored
and as though we don't have enough support from bigger influences like you.
Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many
stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers due to the frequent
violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that
someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You
and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be
successful, still be self-made...
Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the city we
know and love, Chicago.
Sincerely,
Alex Rojas, Alondra Cerros, and Annelisse Betancourt
Lake View High School Students
Chicago, Illinois""
It's not the full letter, but some extracts. It's sweet to observe how young
people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who
cares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back.
It should work.
As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn't forget
who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people's love.
That's cool that this love goes back and forth!
We need more of these positive black people on the media, because some
people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day
different race will be the issue of diversity, not stereotypes.

the Dance Theater of Harlem and was a founding partner of the National

predominantly white. In the sense that efforts were really made to prevent
Black people from participating in such sports, back in the days.
But thanks to Debi Thomas and other Black skaters; we changed the game
and on Feb. 8. 1986. Debi became the first Black skater to hold a US national
titles in ladies' single figure scating.
Debi; a physician, became the 1986 World champion, the 1988 Olympic

"2464","New trends. Often ""new trends"" of American and European cultures is
nothing but reinvention of African legacy. People should pay more attention to
education and history of things. People should know the origins, not to
confuse things. If you want to stress that you use something you taken from
another culture it's one thing. But when you wear (for example) dreadlocks
and don't know anything about its meaning, it can look strange, even weird.
White people do many such things unintentionally. It doesn't make them wise.
Same goes to African Americans who copy white people. Know yourself! We
have beautiful culture and history!

Meet Dr. Marie Daly, Black History's first Black woman biochemist.
In 1947, she became the first African-American woman to earn a Ph.D. in
Chemistry when she graduated from Columbia University.
Today, inspiring many young Black girls to become chemists, Dr. Daly
researched the connection between high cholesterol and heart disease.
Black excellence has a rich and powerful history.

become a doctor. Since that moment Ebony's mother called her ""Dr. Hilton"". It
wasn't easy to follow the dream for Ebony. Or it's better to say that there were
some hardships — for example, Ebony was growing without a father etc, but
despite these things she successfully got the proper education and became
the first black female anesthesiologist in 2013. Hilton says she never had plan
B.
Now she is mentoring youth as a member of program called Girls Loving
OurSelves Successfully (GLOSS).
That's sweet. Black women always show the power in any conditions. That's
inspiring! And it's especially good that Hilton dedicated herself to teaching
others.

ATTENTION! COMMUNITY CALLS FOR A BOYCOTT!
Disturbing video shows Sung Ho Lim, an owner of Missha Beauty (in
Charlotte, NC), kicked and choked a Black woman!
This man absolutely crossed the line! According to Lim, he saw the
unidentified woman stealing eyelashes. But, in the video, you can hear the
woman tell Lim,""Check my bag. I'm telling you I don't have anything."" And
why did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what?
Corine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg chapter of the NAACP demanded
that Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte. But folks, I want it be
not only the boycott of this exact store but all shops and stores where Black
people were treated disrespectfully! We don't believe apologies, especially
when we know that this man is sorry only about profit he's going to lose!","https://www.facebook.com/blacktivists/","United States","N/A","16 - 65+","English (UK)or English (US)","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

Serena said about her sister. Now Serena has 23 major singles titles. She's
about to make a new world record but she's already made history.
Serena is still the best tennis player at her 35. Serena and Venus made tennis
black. Never before the world had a chance to admire black excellence on the
tennis court.
Despite the stupid mockeries aimed at their race and appearance, the
Williams sisters are still the best, full of love and perfection! Thank you sisters!
You made all of us great!

Charlotte, NC), kicked and choked a Black woman!
This man absolutely crossed the line! According to Lim, he saw the
unidentified woman stealing eyelashes. But, in the video, you can hear the
woman tell Lim,""Check my bag. I'm telling you I don't have anything."" And
why did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what?
Corine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg chapter of the NAACP demanded
that Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte. But folks, I want it be
not only the boycott of this exact store but all shops and stores where Black
people were treated disrespectfully! We don't believe apologies, especially
when we know that this man is sorry only about profit he's going to lose!

their rules. Their system is not for us. Sometimes we can succeed in their
game but it's better to concentrate on our own issues. When white people do
something for us they see us as strangers anyway, we will always be ""others""

he was 9-year-old. She began to take him to local museums such as the
Apex, the Sights and Sounds Black Cultural Museum and the Fernbank
Museum of Natural History.
To improve Leon's skills of painting he began to attend art classes of R.
Gregory Christies. Non-profit organization the Southwest Atlanta Youth
Business Organization(SWAYBO)also helped Leon in many ways.
According to blacknews.com, the organization gave him lessons of ""poise
and presentation, public speaking, sales and marketing at marketplaces and
how to perform basic accounting formulas. With SWAYBO, Leon has met
judges, successful business owners and other pillars of the Black
community.""
Now Moss makes illustrations and sells the copies of his works. The first book
with his illustrations is As Big As God.
That's what we call the support of family and the community! Good luck,
Leon! We should believe in ourselves just like Leon's mother believed in him.
Our roots are strong; just imagine how strong you can be if only you grow with
your roots!

accessory line! Gibbs produces at least 5 original ties each day! His mom
helps him. They called their company Classic Knot. Their customers are so
happy to wear these ties that Classic Knot is going to hire some extra
employees!
By the way this business is not an obstacle for school. Shelden's classmates
even offer their help too!
""I teach him the sky is the limit from here. Dream big, think big, don't think
small or you'll always have small,"" said Shelden's mother Rhonda Woods and
she's absolutely right! It's so good that kids are thinking of pleasing other
people and supporting their families!

"2476","Drum and Spear Bookstore in Washington DC was opened by veteran
members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee(SNCC) in
summer of 1968. The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next
year the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company.
One of co-founders said ""We don't define profit in terms of money. The profit
is the patronage of the community, which allows the store to self-support.""
Drum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history,
something beyond the American school program. It's reflected in the name of
the shop: the drum is for ""communications within the diaspora,"" and the
spear symbolizes ""whatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the
people.""
The best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the
Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice.
This bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores.
Drum and Spear and many other stores were not only the shops, but a ""free
spaces""for thinking black people where folks could meet and discuss the vital
issues. Let's not forget our legacy! We need this drum and we need this spear
today, in 2017.

"1120","U.S. ARMY LIFTS BAN ON DREADLOCKS.
After the critics complained about the Army's unfair burden on black women's
hair, the U.S. Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in
April 2014.
The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned
braids and twists amidst the criticism.
Some of the female soldiers used harsh chemicals to keep their hair straight.
Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks
caused a lot of unnecessary stress.
The ban on locs, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until
January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option.
Now the rules allow dreadlocks and locks but only if they are less than a half-
inch wide.
Well, it took months for the Army to recognize that black women have
different hair texture.","https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/","United States","N/A","16 - 65+","English (UK)or English (US)","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

spent a lot of my childhood in different systems and I had no idea about the

explained how his work with wrongfully-convicted clients had shaped his view
of the U.S. criminal justice system, which he described as racially lopsided.

Women's Hall of Fame earlier this month. This is a huge step for a latino
woman in the US. She says: ""Diversity on the bench is so important because
the people that come to court come from all different walks of life, different
ethnic backgrounds, different religious backgrounds.""
However, if it's a sign of diversity, this is a very weak sign. Just think, we are
indigenous inhabitants of this land and we were cut off all privileges since
gabachos came and stole our land. So, it took almost 500 years for our
woman to reach a prestigious position in the government that is not really
caring about us! Whether there are latinos or not, authorities will continue to
deport us from our indigenous land!","https://www.facebook.com/brownunitedfront/","- Living In: United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

He said to them,""But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if
you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.""
— Luke 22:36
What does that mean? Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But
enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always
was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be
followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need
of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would
be exposed to, and of their need of protection.
And we, American Christians, should remember about it. Sometimes you
have to arm yourself to protect your loved ones and friends.","https://www.facebook.com/Army-of-Jesus-I195795607160174/","- Living In: United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

"2832","Shocking video was captured by the police officer body cam.
On September 4, 2013, a student from the University of Central Florida
Victoria King was pulled over by officer Timothy Isaacs for a bad tail light.
The situation escalated quickly when the police officer demanded King to roll
down her window ""all the way"" to receive her ticket. When King refused,
which by the way was a perfectly legal thing to do, the police officer broke out
the car window and arrested her in a brutal way. Instead of simply citing her,
the police officer demanded the woman to obey and threw her to the ground.
When you're Black no violation is small enough. Every contact with the police
ends brutally for Black people and nothing seems to change.

VIDEO SHOWS THEM KICK BLACK MAN DURING TRAFFIC STOP
Two Georgia police officers have been fired after police released the footage
of the encounter where two Gwinnett County cops kicking a black college
student during a traffic stop.
According to a police report; 21-year-old Demetrius Hollins was pulled over
near Lawrenceville for changing lines several times without signaling. When
cops stopped him ; Hollins was seen on video standing with his hands raised
before one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face; and the
second cop racing to the scene later, only to stomp Hollins in his face.
The 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach
him. Hollins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn't have
anything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the
incident cops wrote in their police report that Hollins resisted arrest and
claimed that Hollins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted
arrest. Cops literally lied and had no shame.
This incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law
enforcement. They should be held accountable for their actions. Resignation
is not the answer. We did not hear any criminal charges. even though they
admit the cops broke the law. Where is the justice? FINALLY: TWO

mandatory spending cuts over 10 years, including $800 billion from Medicaid
and $193 billion from food stamps. At the same time, this proposal, called ""A
New Foundation for American Greatness"", includes a boost in military
spending and $1.6 billion for the construction of the border wall with Mexico.
To be honest, I'm not sure, that the wall and another pointless war, instead of
affordable health care and help for those in need, is what we have to keep our
focus on. It seems like republicans are using every single possibility to get
more money for their wars, and they don't mind it if average Americans live in
poverty or without affordable medicine. Why additional billions to Military? Our
Department of Defense budget is already bigger than military budgets of the
next eight countries combined, isn't it enough? Here is what Senate Minority
Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""Based on what we know about this budget, the
good news -- the only good news -- is that it's likely to be roundly rejected by

is nothing more than business for them. It was these people who launched the
missiles that never hit no terrorists but led to civilian casualties. It is them who
keep receiving money from the same actors who sponsor ISIS and other
groups. These people want more American involvement because it means
more money for them and they don't care about the terrorists. In fact, radicals
really help them increase their bloody income. The only way to resist the

"1500","Cops are allergic to cameras, they don't like being recorded because it won't
allow them to break the law and lie about the circumstances which presented
them the opportunity to break the law.
?WARNING!!!? In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in
a public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense
altercation with a student.
According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim,
Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom.
The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a
brief clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him.
I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more
then a bunch of bullies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever
happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an
officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide
something and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also, is not
destruction of evidence a crime?

"2426","The administration is requesting a $54 billion increase in military spending for
2018. Not a small sum, it's roughly equal to the entire annual military budget
of France, larger than the defense budgets of the United Kingdom, Germany,
and Japan, and only $12 billion less than the entire Russian military budget of
2015. But what about domestic and State Department spending? For
example, such an increase for the Department of Defense means 31% cut in
the EPA's budget and a 29% cut in the State Department. In other words, it's
a great number of opportunities squandered in favor of the interests of high-
powerful warmongers in our government. Environment, diplomacy, alternative
energy, housing or infrastructure repair? Not today. Today they want
thousands of peaceful people to die for their money interests. And they use
every opportunity to start another war, they are acting the same way in Syria.

"766","I believe Ron Paul's position on our foreign military policy is absolutely right.
After all, it was Trump who promised to put America First and promised to end
Obama's policy of wasting budget money on military operations overseas.
""We're not going into Syria"", Trump said it to calm down those who got really
concerned about a possibility of America getting involved into another war.
really want to trust these words, but unfortunately many high-ranked
politicians want to force Trump to pull America into another war.
Here's what Ron Paul thinks about it: ""By the end of this month, Defense
Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will
deliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan,
Iraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send
his national security team back to the drawing board — or replace them. There
is no way another ""surge"" in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria)
puts America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will
succeed any better than it did the last time.""
Syria will be just another oil war; Iraq cost our country 4,500 soldier lives, and
why the hell are we still in Afghanistan? We've started the whole Afghanistan
thing to beat the Soviets, and no there's no Soviet Union on the world map,
and all the communists left on this planet are only Chinese and Californian
students.","https://www.facebook.com/patriototus/","- Living In: United States

On April 14 the Plummers' door had been kicked in by burglars.
On April 16 Plummer, his mother, and his 14-year-old little brother did not see
the police lights because the unit was parked down the road.
Plummer called 911 to report the burglars and then grabbed his
Grandfather's shotgun that was given to his mother for protection.
When Plummer went to the door, the scared kid fired a warning shot to fend
off the would-be burglars.
However, the shotgun blast hit one officer in the arm and the other in the face.

drawing our country into another regime change venture. Our military
presence in Syria now doesn't serve American interests. Our soldiers are
there to fight and die for Globalists, Saudis and Israelis, but not for
Americans. And that's why we keep on talking about it: this policy is directly
opposite to the ""America First"" concept.
I believe Trump can fix it, just like he promised. Sadly days after days and
weeks after weeks of Trump's presidency there are no changes in that
direction. Israel captured a Syrian region named Golan Heights in 1967, and
today this land is internationally considered to be occupied territory. Israelis
want to use Trump's influence so the world would acknowledge Israeli
sovereignty. Trump is a dealer, and maybe he's trying make a deal out of it,
but there's one important thing here: under no circumstances can our
soldiers' lives be put at risk for that. So many times during the presidential
campaign Trump said ""let's bring back our soldiers home"", and now it's
really time to do it. This is not our war.","https://www.facebook.com/patriototus/","- Living In: United States

clear: our government is proposing spending cuts to most government
agencies to pay for large increases in military, and everything we got from this
is more and more civilians deaths. EPA, State and other development
programs, Agriculture, Labor, Justice, Health and Human Services,
Education, and many other domestic agencies faced more than 20% cuts in
their budgets, and only the Department of Defense has grown by 10%.
However, terrorists weren't destroyed in '30 days' and it seems like they
won't be destroyed in the closest perspective. I mentioned before, and I will
do it again: this is not a war against terrorism or a war 'for freedom', it's
another example of money conflict, filling politician's pockets with blood
money is the main goal of it. For America, another continuous military conflict

"1478","Everyday we watch, read and receive news of police beating, assaulting, and
killing innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common
that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were
wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,
karma's coming back for blue pigs!
A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police
officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two
officers for seemingly no reason.
The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two
school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza
shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of
police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally
nothing without using their guns.
Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their
own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and
electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing their job."" All those things and
more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my
rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.
Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine
about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is
why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our
ancestors did it for centuries.
Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will change. Amen.","https://www.facebook.com/Dont-Shoot-1157233400960126/","United States

commandership wasting lives of American soldiers for too long, let's hope it
will end now when Trump is in charge.
A new Marine Corps artillery unit was sent to assist Syrian opposition in
Raqqa, according to Army Maj. Josh T. Jacques, a spokesman for U.S.
Central Command. The artillery unit recently replaced about 400 Marines from
the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which provided artillery support to Kurdish
and Syrian Arab forces expected to launch an offensive against Raqqa.
We must deal with ISIS and end the terrorist threat once and for all.
Unfortunately that's hardly possible because of the corruption in the
Government. The Swamp in DC is still not drained from people like Senator
McCain, and that's why our troops not only focus on defeating terrorism, but
also getting involved into another regime change venture and possibly
another oil war.
We're fighting radical Islamists, but we're also siding with Syrian opposition,
the very same radical Islamists, and there's absolutely no guarantee that
these rebels won't replace ISIS when it's gone.
There's only one chance to avoid another Iraq: Trump and the American
nation must defeat globalist politicians and the Establishment. All we can do
now is to pray for all American soldiers to return back home alive and safe.","https://www.facebook.com/patriototus/","- Living In: United States
