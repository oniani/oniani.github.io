"2461","""First and foremost, we as Chicago Public School students would like to thank
you for the supportive donation to our schools. As we all know, CPS has been
struggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to
where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the
community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to
improve our Chicago...
All of the things that you do for our city never go unnoticed. All of the free
concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the city really show you
care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility
away from artists, but it hasn't changed you...
We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others
have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored
and as though we don't have enough support from bigger influences like you.
Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many
stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers due to the frequent
violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that
someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You
and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be
successful, still be self-made...
Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the city we
know and love, Chicago.
Sincerely,
Alex Rojas, Alondra Cerros, and Annelisse Betancourt
Lake View High School Students
Chicago, Illinois""
It's not the full letter, but some extracts. It's sweet to observe how young
people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who
cares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back.
It should work.
As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn't forget
who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people's love.
That's cool that this love goes back and forth!
We need more of these positive black people on the media, because some
people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day
different race will be the issue of diversity, not stereotypes.

Do you believe similar sacrifices from Black people in white supremacy

predominantly white. In the sense that efforts were really made to prevent
Black people from participating in such sports, back in the days.
But thanks to Debi Thomas and other Black skaters; we changed the game
and on Feb. 8. 1986. Debi became the first Black skater to hold a US national
titles in ladies' single figure scating.
Debi; a physician, became the 1986 World champion, the 1988 Olympic
bronze medalist; and a two-time U.S. national champion.

"2464","New trends. Often ""new trends"" of American and European cultures is
nothing but reinvention of African legacy. People should pay more attention to
education and history of things. People should know the origins, not to
confuse things. If you want to stress that you use something you taken from
another culture it's one thing. But when you wear (for example) dreadlocks
and don't know anything about its meaning, it can look strange, even weird.
White people do many such things unintentionally. It doesn't make them wise.
Same goes to African Americans who copy white people. Know yourself! We
have beautiful culture and history!

Meet Dr. Marie Daly, Black History's first Black woman biochemist.
In 1947, she became the first African-American woman to earn a Ph.D. in
Chemistry when she graduated from Columbia University.
Today, inspiring many young Black girls to become chemists, Dr. Daly
researched the connection between high cholesterol and heart disease.
Black excellence has a rich and powerful history.

"2460","When Ebony Hilton was 8, she promised her mother that one day she will
become a doctor. Since that moment Ebony's mother called her ""Dr. Hilton"". It
wasn't easy to follow the dream for Ebony. Or it's better to say that there were
some hardships — for example, Ebony was growing without a father etc, but
despite these things she successfully got the proper education and became
the first black female anesthesiologist in 2013. Hilton says she never had plan
B.
Now she is mentoring youth as a member of program called Girls Loving
OurSelves Successfully (GLOSS).
That's sweet. Black women always show the power in any conditions. That's
inspiring! And it's especially good that Hilton dedicated herself to teaching
others.

ATTENTION! COMMUNITY CALLS FOR A BOYCOTT!
Disturbing video shows Sung Ho Lim, an owner of Missha Beauty (in
Charlotte, NC), kicked and choked a Black woman!
This man absolutely crossed the line! According to Lim, he saw the
unidentified woman stealing eyelashes. But, in the video, you can hear the
woman tell Lim,""Check my bag. I'm telling you I don't have anything."" And
why did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what?
Corine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg chapter of the NAACP demanded
that Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte. But folks, I want it be
not only the boycott of this exact store but all shops and stores where Black

Serena said about her sister. Now Serena has 23 major singles titles. She's
about to make a new world record but she's already made history.
Serena is still the best tennis player at her 35. Serena and Venus made tennis
black. Never before the world had a chance to admire black excellence on the
tennis court.
Despite the stupid mockeries aimed at their race and appearance, the
Williams sisters are still the best, full of love and perfection! Thank you sisters!

he was 9-year-old. She began to take him to local museums such as the
Apex, the Sights and Sounds Black Cultural Museum and the Fernbank
Museum of Natural History.
To improve Leon's skills of painting he began to attend art classes of R.
Gregory Christies. Non-profit organization the Southwest Atlanta Youth
Business Organization(SWAYBO)also helped Leon in many ways.
According to blacknews.com, the organization gave him lessons of ""poise
and presentation, public speaking, sales and marketing at marketplaces and
how to perform basic accounting formulas. With SWAYBO, Leon has met
judges, successful business owners and other pillars of the Black
community.""
Now Moss makes illustrations and sells the copies of his works. The first book
with his illustrations is As Big As God.
That's what we call the support of family and the community! Good luck,
Leon! We should believe in ourselves just like Leon's mother believed in him.
Our roots are strong; just imagine how strong you can be if only you grow with
your roots!

Harvard University is one of the best schools in the whole world and when a

Education for the Black people was never easy, starting slave period when
Black people could be killed for reading a book, including today when
thousands of kids cannot get the education because of their skin color and the
prejudice of the teachers, and this girl is proving that times are changing.
Recently Black women were called the most educated group of people in the
US and years by, we can see that those women are starting to make
changes. Here and there we hear the news about Black people holding the

"2476","Drum and Spear Bookstore in Washington DC was opened by veteran
members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee(SNCC) in
summer of 1968. The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next
year the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company.
One of co-founders said ""We don't define profit in terms of money. The profit
is the patronage of the community, which allows the store to self-support.""
Drum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history,
something beyond the American school program. It's reflected in the name of
the shop: the drum is for ""communications within the diaspora,"" and the
spear symbolizes ""whatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the
people.""
The best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the
Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice.
This bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores.
Drum and Spear and many other stores were not only the shops, but a ""free
spaces""for thinking black people where folks could meet and discuss the vital
issues. Let's not forget our legacy! We need this drum and we need this spear
today, in 2017.

"1120","U.S. ARMY LIFTS BAN ON DREADLOCKS.
After the critics complained about the Army's unfair burden on black women's
hair, the U.S. Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in
April 2014.
The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned
braids and twists amidst the criticism.
Some of the female soldiers used harsh chemicals to keep their hair straight.
Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks
caused a lot of unnecessary stress.
The ban on locs, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until
January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option.
Now the rules allow dreadlocks and locks but only if they are less than a half-
inch wide.
Well, it took months for the Army to recognize that black women have

spent a lot of my childhood in different systems and I had no idea about the
beast that communities of color are fighting. My mother didn't know about the
school-to-prison pipeline, she just knew she had a black boy."" Coleman
explained how his work with wrongfully-convicted clients had shaped his view
of the U.S. criminal justice system, which he described as racially lopsided.

said. ""It's a fact of life and of the prison system. If most of the people going
into the system are black men, most of my clients will be too."" The Duke
Journal of Gender Law and Policy hosted a symposium Tuesday focusing on

two tours of duty in Afghanistan where he suffered a brain injury in an
explosion. Perez served seven years; but because he is not a U.S. citizen,
Immigration Customs Enforcement detained him, stripped his legal status and
began the deportation process.

He said to them,""But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if
you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.""
— Luke 22:36
What does that mean? Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But
enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always
was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be
followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need
of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would
be exposed to, and of their need of protection.
And we, American Christians, should remember about it. Sometimes you
have to arm yourself to protect your loved ones and friends.","https://www.facebook.com/Army-of-Jesus-I195795607160174/","- Living In: United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile
