"2461","""First and foremost, we as Chicago Public School students would like to thank
you for the supportive donation to our schools. As we all know, CPS has been
struggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to
where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the
community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to
improve our Chicago...
All of the things that you do for our city never go unnoticed. All of the free
concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the city really show you
care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility
away from artists, but it hasn't changed you...
We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others
have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored
and as though we don't have enough support from bigger influences like you.
Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many
stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers due to the frequent
violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that
someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You
and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be
successful, still be self-made...
Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the city we
know and love, Chicago.
Sincerely,
Alex Rojas, Alondra Cerros, and Annelisse Betancourt
Lake View High School Students
Chicago, Illinois""
It's not the full letter, but some extracts. It's sweet to observe how young
people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who
cares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back.
It should work.
As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn't forget
who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people's love.
That's cool that this love goes back and forth!
We need more of these positive black people on the media, because some
people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day
different race will be the issue of diversity, not stereotypes.

Do you believe similar sacrifices from Black people in white supremacy

predominantly white. In the sense that efforts were really made to prevent
Black people from participating in such sports, back in the days.
But thanks to Debi Thomas and other Black skaters; we changed the game
and on Feb. 8. 1986. Debi became the first Black skater to hold a US national
titles in ladies' single figure scating.
Debi; a physician, became the 1986 World champion, the 1988 Olympic
bronze medalist; and a two-time U.S. national champion.

"2464","New trends. Often ""new trends"" of American and European cultures is
nothing but reinvention of African legacy. People should pay more attention to
education and history of things. People should know the origins, not to
confuse things. If you want to stress that you use something you taken from
another culture it's one thing. But when you wear (for example) dreadlocks
and don't know anything about its meaning, it can look strange, even weird.
White people do many such things unintentionally. It doesn't make them wise.
Same goes to African Americans who copy white people. Know yourself! We
have beautiful culture and history!

Meet Dr. Marie Daly, Black History's first Black woman biochemist.
In 1947, she became the first African-American woman to earn a Ph.D. in
Chemistry when she graduated from Columbia University.
Today, inspiring many young Black girls to become chemists, Dr. Daly
researched the connection between high cholesterol and heart disease.
Black excellence has a rich and powerful history.

"2460","When Ebony Hilton was 8, she promised her mother that one day she will
become a doctor. Since that moment Ebony's mother called her ""Dr. Hilton"". It
wasn't easy to follow the dream for Ebony. Or it's better to say that there were
some hardships — for example, Ebony was growing without a father etc, but
despite these things she successfully got the proper education and became
the first black female anesthesiologist in 2013. Hilton says she never had plan
B.
Now she is mentoring youth as a member of program called Girls Loving
OurSelves Successfully (GLOSS).
That's sweet. Black women always show the power in any conditions. That's
inspiring! And it's especially good that Hilton dedicated herself to teaching
others.

ATTENTION! COMMUNITY CALLS FOR A BOYCOTT!
Disturbing video shows Sung Ho Lim, an owner of Missha Beauty (in
Charlotte, NC), kicked and choked a Black woman!
This man absolutely crossed the line! According to Lim, he saw the
unidentified woman stealing eyelashes. But, in the video, you can hear the
woman tell Lim,""Check my bag. I'm telling you I don't have anything."" And
why did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what?
Corine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg chapter of the NAACP demanded
that Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte. But folks, I want it be
not only the boycott of this exact store but all shops and stores where Black

Serena said about her sister. Now Serena has 23 major singles titles. She's
about to make a new world record but she's already made history.
Serena is still the best tennis player at her 35. Serena and Venus made tennis
black. Never before the world had a chance to admire black excellence on the
tennis court.
Despite the stupid mockeries aimed at their race and appearance, the
Williams sisters are still the best, full of love and perfection! Thank you sisters!

he was 9-year-old. She began to take him to local museums such as the
Apex, the Sights and Sounds Black Cultural Museum and the Fernbank
Museum of Natural History.
To improve Leon's skills of painting he began to attend art classes of R.
Gregory Christies. Non-profit organization the Southwest Atlanta Youth
Business Organization(SWAYBO)also helped Leon in many ways.
According to blacknews.com, the organization gave him lessons of ""poise
and presentation, public speaking, sales and marketing at marketplaces and
how to perform basic accounting formulas. With SWAYBO, Leon has met
judges, successful business owners and other pillars of the Black
community.""
Now Moss makes illustrations and sells the copies of his works. The first book
with his illustrations is As Big As God.
That's what we call the support of family and the community! Good luck,
Leon! We should believe in ourselves just like Leon's mother believed in him.
Our roots are strong; just imagine how strong you can be if only you grow with
your roots!

Harvard University is one of the best schools in the whole world and when a

Education for the Black people was never easy, starting slave period when
Black people could be killed for reading a book, including today when
thousands of kids cannot get the education because of their skin color and the
prejudice of the teachers, and this girl is proving that times are changing.
Recently Black women were called the most educated group of people in the
US and years by, we can see that those women are starting to make
changes. Here and there we hear the news about Black people holding the

"2476","Drum and Spear Bookstore in Washington DC was opened by veteran
members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee(SNCC) in
summer of 1968. The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next
year the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company.
One of co-founders said ""We don't define profit in terms of money. The profit
is the patronage of the community, which allows the store to self-support.""
Drum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history,
something beyond the American school program. It's reflected in the name of
the shop: the drum is for ""communications within the diaspora,"" and the
spear symbolizes ""whatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the
people.""
The best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the
Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice.
This bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores.
Drum and Spear and many other stores were not only the shops, but a ""free
spaces""for thinking black people where folks could meet and discuss the vital
issues. Let's not forget our legacy! We need this drum and we need this spear
today, in 2017.

"1120","U.S. ARMY LIFTS BAN ON DREADLOCKS.
After the critics complained about the Army's unfair burden on black women's
hair, the U.S. Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in
April 2014.
The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned
braids and twists amidst the criticism.
Some of the female soldiers used harsh chemicals to keep their hair straight.
Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks
caused a lot of unnecessary stress.
The ban on locs, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until
January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option.
Now the rules allow dreadlocks and locks but only if they are less than a half-
inch wide.
Well, it took months for the Army to recognize that black women have

spent a lot of my childhood in different systems and I had no idea about the
beast that communities of color are fighting. My mother didn't know about the
school-to-prison pipeline, she just knew she had a black boy."" Coleman
explained how his work with wrongfully-convicted clients had shaped his view
of the U.S. criminal justice system, which he described as racially lopsided.

said. ""It's a fact of life and of the prison system. If most of the people going
into the system are black men, most of my clients will be too."" The Duke
Journal of Gender Law and Policy hosted a symposium Tuesday focusing on

two tours of duty in Afghanistan where he suffered a brain injury in an
explosion. Perez served seven years; but because he is not a U.S. citizen,
Immigration Customs Enforcement detained him, stripped his legal status and
began the deportation process.

He said to them,""But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if
you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.""
— Luke 22:36
What does that mean? Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But
enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always
was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be
followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need
of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would
be exposed to, and of their need of protection.
And we, American Christians, should remember about it. Sometimes you
have to arm yourself to protect your loved ones and friends.","https://www.facebook.com/Army-of-Jesus-I195795607160174/","- Living In: United States","N/A","18 - 65+","N/A","News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

On September 4, 2013, a student from the University of Central Florida
Victoria King was pulled over by officer Timothy Isaacs for a bad tail light.
The situation escalated quickly when the police officer demanded King to roll
down her window ""all the way"" to receive her ticket. When King refused,
which by the way was a perfectly legal thing to do, the police officer broke out
the car window and arrested her in a brutal way. Instead of simply citing her,
the police officer demanded the woman to obey and threw her to the ground.
When you're Black no violation is small enough. Every contact with the police
ends brutally for Black people and nothing seems to change.

VIDEO SHOWS THEM KICK BLACK MAN DURING TRAFFIC STOP
Two Georgia police officers have been fired after police released the footage
of the encounter where two Gwinnett County cops kicking a black college
student during a traffic stop.
According to a police report; 21-year-old Demetrius Hollins was pulled over
near Lawrenceville for changing lines several times without signaling. When
cops stopped him ; Hollins was seen on video standing with his hands raised
before one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face; and the
second cop racing to the scene later, only to stomp Hollins in his face.
The 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach
him. Hollins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn't have
anything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the
incident cops wrote in their police report that Hollins resisted arrest and
claimed that Hollins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted
arrest. Cops literally lied and had no shame.
This incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law
enforcement. They should be held accountable for their actions. Resignation
is not the answer. We did not hear any criminal charges. even though they
admit the cops broke the law. Where is the justice? FINALLY: TWO

allow them to break the law and lie about the circumstances which presented
them the opportunity to break the law.
?WARNING!!!? In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in
a public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense
altercation with a student.
According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim,
Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom.
The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a
brief clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him.
I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more
then a bunch of bullies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever
happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an
officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide
something and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also, is not
destruction of evidence a crime?

2018. Not a small sum, it's roughly equal to the entire annual military budget
of France, larger than the defense budgets of the United Kingdom, Germany,
and Japan, and only $12 billion less than the entire Russian military budget of
2015. But what about domestic and State Department spending? For
example, such an increase for the Department of Defense means 31% cut in
the EPA's budget and a 29% cut in the State Department. In other words, it's
a great number of opportunities squandered in favor of the interests of high-
powerful warmongers in our government. Environment, diplomacy, alternative

thousands of peaceful people to die for their money interests. And they use

concerned about a possibility of America getting involved into another war.
really want to trust these words, but unfortunately many high-ranked
politicians want to force Trump to pull America into another war.
Here's what Ron Paul thinks about it: ""By the end of this month, Defense
Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will
deliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan,
Iraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send
his national security team back to the drawing board — or replace them. There
is no way another ""surge"" in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria)
puts America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will
succeed any better than it did the last time.""
Syria will be just another oil war; Iraq cost our country 4,500 soldier lives, and

On April 14 the Plummers' door had been kicked in by burglars.
On April 16 Plummer, his mother, and his 14-year-old little brother did not see
the police lights because the unit was parked down the road.
Plummer called 911 to report the burglars and then grabbed his
Grandfather's shotgun that was given to his mother for protection.
When Plummer went to the door, the scared kid fired a warning shot to fend
off the would-be burglars.
However, the shotgun blast hit one officer in the arm and the other in the face.

drawing our country into another regime change venture. Our military
presence in Syria now doesn't serve American interests. Our soldiers are
there to fight and die for Globalists, Saudis and Israelis, but not for
Americans. And that's why we keep on talking about it: this policy is directly
opposite to the ""America First"" concept.
I believe Trump can fix it, just like he promised. Sadly days after days and
weeks after weeks of Trump's presidency there are no changes in that
direction. Israel captured a Syrian region named Golan Heights in 1967, and
today this land is internationally considered to be occupied territory. Israelis
want to use Trump's influence so the world would acknowledge Israeli
sovereignty. Trump is a dealer, and maybe he's trying make a deal out of it,
but there's one important thing here: under no circumstances can our
soldiers' lives be put at risk for that. So many times during the presidential
campaign Trump said ""let's bring back our soldiers home"", and now it's

their budgets, and only the Department of Defense has grown by 10%.
However, terrorists weren't destroyed in '30 days' and it seems like they
won't be destroyed in the closest perspective. I mentioned before, and I will
do it again: this is not a war against terrorism or a war 'for freedom', it's
another example of money conflict, filling politician's pockets with blood

1478,"Everyday we watch, read and receive news of police beating, assaulting, and
killing innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common
that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were
wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,
karma's coming back for blue pigs!
A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police
officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two
officers for seemingly no reason.
The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two
school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza
shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of
police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally
nothing without using their guns.
Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their
own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and
electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing their job."" All those things and
more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my
rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.
Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine
about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is
why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our
ancestors did it for centuries.
Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will change. Amen.",https://www.facebook.com/Dont-Shoot-1157233400960126/,"United States

will end now when Trump is in charge.
A new Marine Corps artillery unit was sent to assist Syrian opposition in
Raqqa, according to Army Maj. Josh T. Jacques, a spokesman for U.S.
Central Command. The artillery unit recently replaced about 400 Marines from
the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which provided artillery support to Kurdish
and Syrian Arab forces expected to launch an offensive against Raqqa.
We must deal with ISIS and end the terrorist threat once and for all.
Unfortunately that's hardly possible because of the corruption in the
Government. The Swamp in DC is still not drained from people like Senator
McCain, and that's why our troops not only focus on defeating terrorism, but
also getting involved into another regime change venture and possibly
another oil war.
We're fighting radical Islamists, but we're also siding with Syrian opposition,
the very same radical Islamists, and there's absolutely no guarantee that
these rebels won't replace ISIS when it's gone.

the most political courage"". He said that sending troops to Syria was a very
difficult decision, but not bombing Syria was even harder to make. Obama
was hated for not taking actions, but it's better for being hated for not killing
innocent people that for starting a useless war.
Though it was tough, Obama did a great job keeping away from the war that
would take millions from the US budget and get innocent people killed.
Unfortunately, the recent government didn't think twice, before they started
bombing Syria. They will cut the support of Black families in the US to kill
innocent kids in Syria. How did we come to this?!",https://www.facebook.com/PanAfrootsmove/,- Living In: United States,Exclude people who like Pan-African roots MOVE,18 - 65+,English (UK)or English (US),"News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile

2554,"Mexicans are known for their masculinity and militancy, as many wars in the
past say. That's why the US often offers Mexicans to join the armed forces, in
exchange for what they promise to give American citizenship. In this regard,
Mexicans are often sent to the war zone in Syria or other countries, from
where they sometimes do not return. Many Mexicans have to go for it, as
today the process of obtaining American citizenship can last for years and
even dozens of years. The US policy towards Mexicans is becoming
increasingly brutal, therefore, it is necessary to stop any attempts by the US
government to send Mexicans to the war zones, where they fight for any
unknown goals.",https://www.facebook.com/brownunitedfront/,- Living In: United States,N/A,18 - 65+,N/A,"News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile
