# I'm Dave,

a Research Engineer at [DawnLight][dawnlight] â€• a very cool startup founded by
Drs. [Fei-Fei Li][feifei], [Jia Li][jia], and [Arnold Milstein][arnold]. I was
a Machine Learning Intern first, mentored by Drs. [Nathan Liu][nathan], [Erheng
Zhong][erheng], and [S. R. Prakash][prakash], and then transitioned into a
full-time work. We research, design, and build state-of-the-art human-centric
Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies with the goal of reducing costs of
care and most importantly, improving health outcomes to increase independence
and quality of life for everyone!

Research Interests:

- Artificial Intelligence
- Programming Languages
- Emerging Technologies

<p>

Previously, I did an R&D work for [Mayo Clinic][mayo], where I first-authored
several papers that got accepted at the world's leading AI and Biomedical
Informatics conferences and journals, such as [ACM-BCB][acmbcb],
[JAMIA][jamia], etc. I worked directly under Drs. [Feichen Shen][feichen] and
[Yanshan Wang][yanshan] in the division of Dr. [Hongfang Liu][hongfang].

I hold a bachelor's degree in both Computer Science and Mathematics from
[Luther College][luther], a small liberal arts college located in picturesque
Decorah, IA. During my time at college, I did collaborative and individual
research in Topology (math), Automated Unit Testing, AI and authorship
attribution, and Programming Languages and Type Theory. As the final Computer
Science project, my team and I have built [Luther Navigator][luthernavigator],
a project that seeks to provide students a way to share their experiences
abroad.

Prior to college, I was a college dropout (I dropped out from a Georgian
college and eventually obtained my bachelor's from the US college) and worked
as a Salesman and Marketing Coordinator at [Insta][insta], a reputable
Electrical Engineering, Smart Home, and Automation company headquartered in
Tbilisi, Georgia. I have also founded a [startup][warbler], had [another
startup][unleash] project, and did some Graphic Design freelancing work.

While in high school, I have competed in national mathematical Olympiad of
Georgia and was a five-time finalist (back-to-back five times). I was also an
IMO and IPhO nominee for the national team of Georgia. Though, I focused more
on general education and never really dedicated a lot of time to math and
physics. This has ultimately earned me a gold medal for academic excellence
(granted to a handful of graduates in the country), but likely cost me
international competition medals in math and physics.

Before all that, I was a die hard football (actual football) amateur player and
fan.

Other interests include art, economics, recreational programming, music,
information theory, [video games](gaming), anime and manga, space exploration,
and cancer research.
