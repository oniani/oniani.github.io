### Ongoing Projects

- [A project that seeks to provide students a way to share their experiences
  abroad][luther_navigator]
- [A minimal machine learning library, implemented from scratch with OpenCL GPU support][miniml]
- A build system (cross-platform rewrite of [b][b], with better parsing and
  more options)
- A tiny interpreted language written in Haskell (a significant portion of it
  is already written, so might consider porting it to Rust for speed)
