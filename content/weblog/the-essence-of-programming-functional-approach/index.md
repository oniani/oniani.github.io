This blogpost is a general overview of a rather underappreciated programming methodology called
functional programming. Throughout the blogpost, I will occasionally use the purely functional
programming language Haskell as well as an imperative-style programming language Python. There is
also a few lines of C++. I will be assuming the knowledge of basic programming concepts such as
variable assignment, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, functions, loops, and recursion.

It is important to note that the blogpost is just an introduction to the paradigms in functional
programming and does not cover any of them in great detail.

### [What is Functional Programming?](#what-is-functional-programming)

![New keyboard](new-keyboard.png)

As mentioned above, functional programming is just an approach to programming. Particularly, it
refers to programming using functions, hence the name _functional programming_. To better understand
what it means for a programming language to be functional, let's make a short side-by-side
comparison of functional and, wildly popular, imperative style of programming languages and then
discuss the differences in more detail.

|                         Imperative language                          |                    Functional language                     |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------: |
|        Classes and/or structures are the first-class objects         |           Functions are the first-class objects            |
|                     State changes are important                      |        State changes are limited (or non-existent)         |
| The primary control flows include loops, conditionals, and functions | The primary control flows are function calls and recursion |

### [Classes VS Functions](#classes-vs-functions)

The first comparison shows that, generally speaking, in the imperative languages (i.e., _Python,
Java, Lua, Nim etc._), variables (instances of classes and/or structures) dominate over all other
objects. Thus, imperative paradigm makes a clear distinction between variables and functions. On
the other hand, in functional programming languages, functions are the first-class citizens making
virtually everything else rank below them.

Imperative programming languages treat variables as data while functions are generally used just to
manipulate variables or generate data. When programming in a functional language, we say that
functions are very similar to variables. In fact, we say that they are no different than variables
as they not only manipulate the data, but also represent the data themselves. Thus, in the
functional world, we say that the piece of code like a function is also data.

I will give you a concise proof of why functions are data. Remember the table representations of
functions you've learned at some point in the elementary school? That's the proof! Any function can
be represented as a table of values. For instance, consider a function \\( f(x) = 2x \\). The
following will be a table representation of the function.

| \\( x \\) | \\( f(x) \\) |
| :-------: | :----------: |
|     0     |      0       |
|     1     |      2       |
|     2     |      4       |
|     3     |      6       |
|     4     |      8       |
|     5     |      10      |
|     6     |      12      |
|    ...    |     ...      |

Looks more like data? That's because it is the data! We have effectively generated a 2-column table
where each of the cells has a certain value. Reminds of SQL tables or pandas data frames?

### [Natural Results](#natural-results)

Because functions are so important, there are natural results and outcomes which are shared among
most of functional languages.

Let's write a Haskell function to find the factorial of a positive integer.

```haskell
-- | A function to find the factorial of a positive integer
factorial x = product [1..x]  -- easy as that
```

The function builds a list of integers from 1 up to x and then calculates the product of these
elements. This way we effectively get a product \\( 1 \times 2 \times 3 .. \times \ x \\) which is
the same as \\( x! \\). Since we now have a function, we can call it with the actual parameters!

```haskell
print (factorial 1)  -- prints out 1
print (factorial 6)  -- prints out 720
print (factorial 9)  -- prints out 362880
```

As shown above, something that in imperative languages would require importing modules, looping,
etc. is a single line in Haskell. This is one of the outcomes of functions being first-class
citizens. Most functional languages have a rich pool of built-in/predefined functions that help
manipulate data. In the example above, we also see a very interesting notation. Namely, `[1..x]`
which builds up a list of integers from 1 up to \\( x \\) (\\( x \\) must also be an integer such
that \\( x \geq 1 \\)). Thus, another outcome is that data structures and collections can be created
very easily, usually just in a single line of code, leaving more time for the programmer to deal
with functions and the logic. These are some of the reasons why functional languages are so concise.

### [Math, Sets, and Haskell](#math-sets-and-haskell)

Notice that in the factorial function above, I excluded the case when the function is called with
\\( 0 \\) (\\( 0! = 1 \\)). It was done on purpose so that now we are able to add some other
notation and explain the whole function in detail. Below is a better and more complete version of
the function.

```haskell
-- | A function to find the factorial of a number
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial x = product [1..x]
```

`::` - prompts that it is a function declaration

`Integer` - type that can hold any number no matter how big, up to the limit of the machine's memory
(so yes, this means you never have arithmetic overflows).

`->` - tells either what is the type of the next formal parameter or what is the type of the output

Looks similar to something you have seen before? If you have taken any undergraduate math class,
there is a big chance that you've encountered the following notation:

\\[ f : A \rightarrow B : x \mapsto y \\]

The notation above describes/defines a simple function that takes an input from set \\( A \\) and
maps it to the output in the set \\( B \\).

Here is the complete definition of the factorial function that we saw above:

\\[ f : \mathbb{Z}^+\cup \{0\} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^+ : x \mapsto x! \\]

Haskell defines in the similar fashion.

`factorial :: Integer -> Integer` says that `factorial` is a function that takes an element from the
set of integers and maps it to some other element in the set of integers. As opposed to math,
however, Haskell does not use \\( \mapsto \\) notation and instead has the statements below it.

```haskell
factorial 0 = 1
factorial x = product [1..x]
```

The code above is equivalent to saying that if the element is 0, map it to 1 and in all other cases,
map it to the product from 1 up to the element.

### [State Changes and Functional Programming](#state-changes-and-functional-programming)

Functional languages have a limited notion of state and typically, avoid the shared mutable state at
any cost. **Purely** (see [Purely Functional Languages](#purely-functional-languages)) functional
languages like Haskell, do not have any state at all. Since there are no changes in state, there are
no variables. Instead, functional languages offer functions and immutable variables.

To make it clear, let's look at two examples below. One is from Python and the other is from
Haskell.

Python example

```python
# Define a variable 'my_number' and assign it to 3
my_number = 3

# Increment the variable 'my_number' by 1 and reassign it to the result
my_number += 1

print(my_number)  # Prints out 4
```

Let's repeat the same steps in Haskell.

```haskell
myNumber = 3    -- Define a variable 'myNumber' and assign it to 3
myNumber += 1   -- Haskell gags here (infinite loop)

print myNumber  -- This statement is not reachable
```

Looking at the code above, you might have already noticed that Haskell does not allow us to change
the state of the program. Now you might be wondering how could one increment variables.

Here is a short answer:

```haskell
myNumber = 3                  -- Define a variable 'myNumber' and assign it to 3
myOtherNumber = myNumber + 1  -- Define a variable 'myOtherNumber' and assign it to 'myNumber'
myNumber = myOtherNumber      -- Redefine 'myNumber' and set it to 'myOtherNumber'
print myNumber                -- Prints out 4
```

**Longer and better answer**

![Let's recurse, shall we?](recurse-shall-we.png)

You do not really need such increments or decrements in functional programming languages. You can
easily overcome this hindrance through functions and recursion. Therefore, instead of mutating
objects, we use recursion to gradually get to the target.

Here is the example of how one could translate a well-known accumulator pattern from Python to
Haskell.

Here is a classic Python accumulator pattern.

```python
# An accumulator pattern approach for finding
# the sum of the first 100 positive integers.

total = 0
for integer in range(1, 100):
    total += integer

print(total)  # Prints out 5050
```

Here is what it looks like in Haskell.

```haskell
accumulator 1 = 1                        -- The base case for the recursion
accumulator x = x + accumulator (x - 1)  -- The recursive case


main = print (accumulator 100)  -- Prints out 5050
```

In the code excerpt above, we did not use any loops. In fact, we could not use any loops because
functional languages do not support loops. Instead, we defined a function, used the recursion and
calculated the sum of the values through function calls.

_Side note_

In this particular case, we do not even need to implement the recursive accumulator pattern. All we
need to do is use the already predefined `sum` function and so-called texas range list notation that
we have already seen (`[1..x]`).

```haskell
print (sum [1..100])  -- Prints out 5050
```

### [Control Flow](#control-flow)

As we have already seen, there are no for loops or while loops in functional programming languages
and there are good reasons why. Let's list a few of them and continue our discussion by elaborating
on those reasons.

- Functional languages are declarative.
- Most of functional languages are heavily influenced by lambda calculus.
- If you were to implement a functional programming language,
  you would yourself get rid of loops.

#### [Functional Languages Are Declarative](#1-functional-languages-are-declarative)

For those who are new to the idea of declarative languages, let's first discuss what it means for a
language to be declarative. Here is a simple definition:

> Declarative programming is a method to abstract away the control flow for logic required for
> performing an action, and instead involves stating what the task or desired outcome is.

The examples of declarative languages are SQL, Haskell, Prolog etc.

_Example 1_: Consider the SQL querying language. In SQL, one doesn't describe what how to get the
data. One just tells SQL what data is needed, and SQL engine figures out the best way to get it.

_Example 2_: A better example might be comparing two implementations of a simple function. Let's
implement them in both Python and Haskell.

The function takes a list of integers and returns the sum of odd integers in it.

```python
def odd_sum(list_of_integers):
    """Return the sum of all odd integers in the list."""
    total = 0
    for integer in list_of_integers:
        if integer % 2 == 1:
            total += integer
    return total


print(odd_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Prints out 9
```

Let's do a shallow analysis of the `odd_sum` function. As seen above, it starts by declaring a
variable `total` which is initially set to 0. Then, we iterate over the list and through each
iteration, we check if the integer is odd and if it is, we add it to `total`. In the end, we return
the `total` variable.

Now, that we have analyzed the function a bit, notice that in the for loop, through each iteration,
we are giving Python directions when to add the integer to `total` (only if it is odd). Thus, **we
tell Python what to do step-by-step**. This is an important characteristic that distinguishes
non-declarative languages from declarative ones.

Let's now look at the Haskell example.

```haskell
oddSum x = sum (filter odd x)

main = print (oddSum [1,2,3,4,5])  -- Prints out 9
```

Notice what we did here. First we defined a function `oddSum` which takes a list. Then we used the
function `filter` (happened to be predefined) in conjunction with another predefined function `odd`
(returns true if the value is odd an false otherwise) to get the list of odd integers. Finally, we
summed up all the odd integers and got the result.

See the difference? In Python, we used a for loop and through each iteration, we told Python whether
to add the integer it to `total` or not. In Haskell, however, we gave a whole list to the function
and told it to just remove all of the even integers from the list and then to sum up the rest (if
you eliminate all the even integers, you are obviously left with all the odd integers). In other
words, in the Haskell example, we do not care how the functions `sum` and `filter` work internally,
we only care about the fact that they do their job - sum up the odd numbers in the list and return
the value.

#### [Functional Programming And Lambda Calculus](#2-functional-programming-and-lambda-calculus)

![Half-Life video game series](half-life-lambda.jpg)

Lambda calculus (also written as (\\( \lambda \\)-calculus) is a branch of mathematics which was
developed by [Alonzo Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church) in the 1930s. It is a
formal system for expressing computation and an alternative to what's called [Turing
machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) which was introduced by [Alan
Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing). Turing machines involve loops and other
non-declarative approaches (Turing machines are the inspiration for programming languages like Java,
Python, etc). A few years later, Church and Turing collaboratively wrote a paper which is now know
as the [computability thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis) and proved
that all the computation that was done using Turing machines could effectively be done in lambda
calculus as well. Hence, simply put, lambda calculus has the power equivalent to that of Turing
machines. Not too long after, people decided to base programming languages on the ideas in lambda
calculus (it was just as powerful as Turing machines so why not?!). This led to shared
characteristics among functional languages such as lack of loops. Virtually all functional
programming languages have no loops because lambda calculus has no loops. One could certainly add
loops, but they would have been redundant. Instead, functional languages use a mathematical idea of
recursion. This is the part of the reason why loops are not that appreciated in the functional
world.

#### [Getting Rid of Loops](#3-getting-rid-of-loops)

![For loop VS Runtime stack](loop-recursion_stack.png)

Despite the fact that sometimes they are very useful, loops must not be a part
of a functional programming language. There are several reasons for this.

1. Loops promote and advocate the idea of "imperativeness" (prompting the language what to do).
2. Loops usually involve mutating values which is, once again, against functional virtues.
3. Even if we did not use it imperatively and not mutate values, it would create unnecessary
   redundance in a language with the emphasis on recursion (which is just as powerful as a
   regular loop!)

### [Purely Functional Languages](#purely-functional-languages)

You might have seen word _pure_ in the beginning of the blogpost where I mentioned that Haskell is
_purely_ functional programming language. However, I never defined what it means for a functional
language to be pure. So let's do it now!

Those who read the [Math, Sets, and Haskell](#math-sets-and-haskell), remember the math notation for
functions? I will use them to take the mystery out of this concept of being _pure_!

Suppose we have a function \\( f : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \\). Then by just looking at
the function, we see that it takes an input from a set of integers and its output is also in the set
of integers. In other words, function \\( f \\) cannot take inputs like -1.9, 0.2, 12.7 etc. as well
as it cannot give an output like 12.6, 71.9, -9.1 etc. Its input(s) and output(s) could
**<u>only</u>** be integers.

Now, let's actually make this dull function \\( f \\) do something. Consider the function \\( f :
\mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} : x \mapsto 2x \\). Thus, we have a function which does a fairly
straightforward thing: takes an integer and maps it to twice its value (which will also be an
integer). Let's now look at the Haskell implementation of this function

```haskell
-- | A function that takes an input and outputs twice its value
f :: Integer -> Integer
f x = 2 * x
```

The function above says that the input (corresponds to the `Integer` before the arrow) is always an
integer and the output (corresponds to the `integer` after the arrow) is also an integer. **Hence,
we always know what type is the input and what type is the output.** In fact, we also know that the
if we call a function with say 5, we will always get the same result. Namely, `f 5 = 10`. Hence, we
got that input(s) and output(s) are always integers and the function called with same actual
parameters always return the same value! This is what makes Haskell a purely functional language.
**At any given point in time, we always know what is the type of input and what is type of output.
Besides, we know that the function called with the same actual parameter(s), always returns the same
value**. Such functions virtually never produce side effects since we already know what to expect
for a given input. **Such functions are called pure!**

To further demystify this idea, let's look at the following piece of code from a C++ programming
language.

```cpp
/*
 * An example of a function that is pretending to be pure.
 *
 */

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int rng(int value) {
    return value + rand() % 3;
}

int main() {
    cout << "Returns: " << rng(7) << endl;  // Prints out 8
    cout << "Returns: " << rng(7) << endl;  // Prints out 8
    cout << "Returns: " << rng(7) << endl;  // Prints out 7
}
```

Here, we defined a function that takes an integer input and it seems like the output is also an
integer. We now might be lured into thinking that function `rng` gives the same output for the same
input, but that is clearly not the case here. Let's take a closer look at what the function does. It
takes an integer value and returns the value plus some random number which is 0, 1 or 2. When we
first called the function with the actual parameter 7, we got 8 as an output. The second time, we
got 8 again. The third time however, we got 7. Hence, for the third time, the output was not the
same. Therefore, the function is not pure.

You now might wondering why I could not do the same trick in Haskell. In fact, I certainly can.
However, in Haskell, such function would not have a type `Int`. It would have a type `IO Int`. `IO`
is usually associated with file input / output and it is reasonable that it is associated with
functions that are not always "truthful" as File I/O could in fact be one of the nastiest
experiences for a programmer. So many things can go wrong! (e.g., writing to a file which was
deleted, reading from a file on a USB which was ejected, writing a file that was moved to some other
directory etc). Thus, when we deal with uncertainty (which usually comes with side effects), Haskell
warns us by using the `IO` notation:

```haskell
{-
Example of a function that if called with the same argument,
does not always return the same result.
-}

import System.Random (randomRIO)


notAPureFunction :: Int -> IO Int
notAPureFunction value = do
    randomValue <- randomRIO (0,2)
    return (value + randomValue)


main = do
    x <- notAPureFunction 7
    print x                  -- Prints out 9
    x <- notAPureFunction 7
    print x                  -- Prints out 7
    x <- notAPureFunction 7
    print x                  -- Prints out 9
```

Take a look at the Haskell code above. You can disregard all the notational fluff. Just look at the
return type of the function `notAPureFunction`. It is `IO Int`! In other words, Haskell informs us
that the function might have side effects.

Finally, we can have sort of a definition of a pure functional language.

> A functional language is pure if and only if the user is informed of all the side effects in a
> language or there are no side effects at all.

In fact, Haskell did not even allow random values back in 1990s when its development was first
launched. Furthermore, there was no notion of File IO either and writing to files was done using
shell redirection commands (i.e., `runhaskell Program.hs > out.txt`). Because of this, Haskell was
considered useless for all practical purposes. Eventually, developers and the Haskell committee
decided to change the direction of Haskell. In lieu of getting rid of all the side effects, they
decided to control the side effects and created a more "regulated" programming environment.

### [Conclusion](#conclusion)

Functional programming languages are different from imperative ones. Most of them are based on ideas
in lambda calculus. Functional languages are the proper subset of declarative languages. There are
no loops and recursion is used instead. Changes in state are non-existent and therefore, all the
variables are immutable. Functional languages have a bunch of predefined functions to make it easy
for a programmer to solve problems. Most of functional languages are also very concise minimizing
the time spent on coding and leaving more time for the logic. Pure functional languages are the
proper subset of functional languages. Purely functional languages inform the user about the side
effects in advance.

### [How to Get Started with Functional Programming?](#how-to-get-started-with-functional-programming)

![Haskell logo](haskell-logo.png)

There are lots of functional languages. You will obviously have to decide which one to learn first.
My recommendation would be learning Haskell. It is a purely functional programming language which
has most of (if not all) the functional ideas in it. Besides, SPJ ([Simon Payton
Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Peyton_Jones)) dedicates most of his time on extending
the language and adding new features to it. So if there is something new and interesting in the
world of functional programming, Haskell will likely get it too.

After learning one functional language, it is not difficult (being familiar with one functional
language automatically makes you somewhat familiar with others) to transition to the other. Hence,
once you have a good grasp of functional ideas in Haskell, you can then move to languages like
Clojure, Scheme, F# etc.

To get started, visit the [Haskell documentation](https://www.haskell.org/documentation) page which
is full of various educational resources.
