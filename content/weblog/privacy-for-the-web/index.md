Just wanted to make a few suggestions and options for improving the web privacy:

- Lightweight Privacy: Emphasis on Usability and Speed

  - [Brave](https://brave.com/) as the default browser

    - [Bitwarden](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/) for password management
    - [Searx](https://searx.me/) as the default search engine
    - [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) to block ads (and other junk)

  - [Signal](https://signal.org/) as a messenger
  - [Element](https://element.io/about) for group chats and collaborations
  - [Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/) in lieu of Zoom
  - [Tox](https://tox.chat/) is also great for group (or one-on-one) chats
  - [Protonmail](https://protonmail.com/) for the email service

- Heavier Privacy: Emphasis on Privacy
  - Use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)

* Super Advanced Privacy: Stronger Emphasis on Privacy
  - Do not use the web
