A few words concerning the privacy on the web.

NOTE: The blogpost will get occasional updates, when needed.

Here are my recommendations for the web privacy.

- Lightweight Privacy: Emphasis on Usability and Speed

  - [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) as the default browser

    - [Bitwarden](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/) for password management
    - [NoScript Security Suite](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/)
    - [Privacy Possum](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-possum/) to reduce and falsify data gathered by trackers
    - [Searx](https://searx.me/) as the default search engine
    - [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) to block ads (and other junk)

  - [Signal](https://signal.org/) as a messenger
  - [Element](https://element.io/about) for group chats and collaborations
  - [Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/) in lieu of Zoom
  - [Tox](https://tox.chat/) is also great for group (or one-on-one) chats
  - [Protonmail](https://protonmail.com/) for the email service

- Heavier Privacy: Emphasis on Privacy
  - Use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)

* Super Advanced Privacy: Stronger Emphasis on Privacy
  - Do not use the web
