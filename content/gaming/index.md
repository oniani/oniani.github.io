I love video games!

I have been playing all sorts of video games on and off since the age of 6.

Some of the ones I have spent most time with include:

- Counter Strike (both 1.6 and Global Offensive) - 5+ years
- Clash of Clans (mobile game) - 5+ years
- League of Legends - 5+ years

As of now, I play [League of Legends](https://play.na.leagueoflegends.com/en_US), [Counter Strike: Global Offensive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/), and [Oxygen Not Included](https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/).
