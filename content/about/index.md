Hello, I am David. Currently, doing an R&D work at [DawnLight][dawnlight], a
very cool startup founded by Drs. [Fei-Fei Li][feifei], [Jia Li][jia], and
[Arnold Milstein][arnold]. I work under Drs. [Nathan Liu][nathan], [Erheng
Zhong][erheng], and [S. R. Prakash][prakash]. We research, design, and build
state-of-the-art human-centric Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions with the
goal of reducing costs of care and most importantly, improving health outcomes
to increase independence and quality of life for everyone!

Previously, I did an R&D work for Mayo Clinic, where I first-authored several
papers that got accepted at the world's leading AI and Biomedical Informatics
conferences and journals, such as [ACM-BCB][acmbcb], [JAMIA][jamia], etc. I
worked directly under Drs. [Feichen Shen][feichen] and [Yanshan Wang][yanshan]
in the division of Dr. [Hongfang Liu][hongfang].

I hold a bachelor's degree in both Computer Science and Mathematics from
[Luther College][luther], a small liberal arts college located in picturesque
Decorah, IA. During my time at college, I did collaborative and individual
research in Topology (math), Automated Unit Testing, AI and authorship
attribution, and Programming Languages and Type Theory. As the final Computer
Science project, my team and I have built [Luther Navigator][luthernavigator],
a project that seeks to provide students a way to share their experiences
abroad.

Prior to college, I was a college dropout (I dropped out from a Georgian
college and eventually obtained my bachelor's from the US college) and worked
as a Salesman and Marketing Coordinator at [Insta][insta], a reputable
Electrical Engineering, Smart Home, and Automation company headquartered in
Tbilisi, Georgia. I have also founded a [startup][warbler], had [another
startup][unleash] project, and did some Graphic Design freelancing work.

While in high school, I have competed in national mathematical Olympiad of
Georgia and was a five-time finalist (TOP 30/3000 back-to-back five times). I
was also an IMO and IPhO nominee for the national team of Georgia. Though, I
concentrated more on general education and never really dedicated a lot of time
to math and physics. That ultimately earned me a gold medal for academic
excellence (granted to a handful of graduates in the country), but likely cost
me international competition medals in math and physics.

Before all that, I was a die hard football (actual football) amateur player and
fan.

My CV is available [here](cv.pdf).

Research interests:

- Artificial Intelligence
- Programming Languages
- Emerging Technologies

Other interests include art, economics, recreational programming, music,
information theory, [video games](https://www.davidoniani.com/gaming), anime
and manga, space exploration, and cancer research.
