<p>Hello, I am David. Currently, doing an R&amp;D work at <a href="https://www.dawnlight.com/home">DawnLight</a>, a
very cool startup founded by Drs. <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/fei-fei-li">Fei-Fei Li</a>, <a href="http://vision.stanford.edu/lijiali/">Jia Li</a>, and
<a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/arnold-milstein">Arnold Milstein</a>. I work under Drs. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OKjAP7AAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Nathan Liu</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lEIE6H0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Erheng
Zhong</a>, and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/S-R-Prakash">S. R. Prakash</a>. We research, design, and build
state-of-the-art human-centric Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions with the
goal of reducing costs of care and most importantly, improving health outcomes
to increase independence and quality of life for everyone!</p>
<p>Previously, I did an R&amp;D work for Mayo Clinic, where I first-authored several
papers that got accepted at the world's leading AI and Biomedical Informatics
conferences and journals, such as <a href="https://acm-bcb.org/">ACM-BCB</a>, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jamia">JAMIA</a>, etc. I
worked directly under Drs. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/shen-feichen-ph-d/bio-20238745">Feichen Shen</a> and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/wang-yanshan-ph-d/bio-20199713">Yanshan Wang</a>
in the division of Dr. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/liu-hongfang-ph-d/bio-00055092">Hongfang Liu</a>.</p>
<p>I hold a bachelor's degree in both Computer Science and Mathematics from
<a href="https://www.luther.edu/">Luther College</a>, a small liberal arts college located in picturesque
Decorah, IA. During my time at college, I did collaborative and individual
research in Topology (math), Automated Unit Testing, AI and authorship
attribution, and Programming Languages and Type Theory. As the final Computer
Science project, my team and I have built <a href="https://www.luthernavigator.com/">Luther Navigator</a>,
a project that seeks to provide students a way to share their experiences
abroad.</p>
<p>Prior to college, I was a college dropout (I dropped out from a Georgian
college and eventually obtained my bachelor's from the US college) and worked
as a Salesman and Marketing Coordinator at <a href="https://www.insta.ge/?v=7516fd43adaa">Insta</a>, a reputable
Electrical Engineering, Smart Home, and Automation company headquartered in
Tbilisi, Georgia. I have also founded a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/warblerltd">startup</a>, had <a href="https://www.unleashar.net/">another
startup</a> project, and did some Graphic Design freelancing work.</p>
<p>While in high school, I have competed in national mathematical Olympiad of
Georgia and was a five-time finalist (TOP 30/3000 back-to-back five times). I
was also an IMO and IPhO nominee for the national team of Georgia. Though, I
focused more on general education and never really dedicated a lot of time to
math and physics. This has ultimately earned me a gold medal for academic
excellence (granted to a handful of graduates in the country), but likely cost
me international competition medals in math and physics.</p>
<p>Before all that, I was a die hard football (actual football) amateur player and
fan.</p>
<p>My CV is available <a href="https://www.davidoniani.com/about/cv.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Research interests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
<li>Programming Languages</li>
<li>Emerging Technologies</li>
</ul>
<p>Other interests include art, economics, recreational programming, music,
information theory, <a href="https://www.davidoniani.com/gaming">video games</a>, anime
and manga, space exploration, and cancer research.</p>
