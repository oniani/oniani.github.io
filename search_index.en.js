Throughout the blogpost, I will occasionally use the purely functional\nprogramming language Haskell as well as an imperative-style programming language Python. There is\nalso a few lines of C++. I will be assuming the knowledge of basic programming concepts such as\nvariable assignment, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, functions, loops, and recursion.\nIt is important to note that the blogpost is just an introduction to the paradigms in functional\nprogramming and does not cover any of them in great detail.\nWhat is Functional Programming?\n\nAs mentioned above, functional programming is just an approach to programming. Particularly, it\nrefers to programming using functions, hence the name functional programming. To better understand\nwhat it means for a programming language to be functional, let's make a short side-by-side\ncomparison of functional and, wildly popular, imperative style of programming languages and then\ndiscuss the differences in more detail.\nImperative languageFunctional language\nClasses and/or structures are the first-class objectsFunctions are the first-class objects\nState changes are importantState changes are limited (or non-existent)\nThe primary control flows include loops, conditionals, and functionsThe primary control flows are function calls and recursion\n\nClasses VS Functions\nThe first comparison shows that, generally speaking, in the imperative languages (i.e., Python,\nJava, Lua, Nim etc.), variables (instances of classes and/or structures) dominate over all other\nobjects. Thus, imperative paradigm makes a clear distinction between variables and functions. On\nthe other hand, in functional programming languages, functions are the first-class citizens making\nvirtually everything else rank below them.\nImperative programming languages treat variables as data while functions are generally used just to\nmanipulate variables or generate data. When programming in a functional language, we say that\nfunctions are very similar to variables. In fact, we say that they are no different than variables\nas they not only manipulate the data, but also represent the data themselves. Thus, in the\nfunctional world, we say that the piece of code like a function is also data.\nI will give you a concise proof of why functions are data. Remember the table representations of\nfunctions you've learned at some point in the elementary school? That's the proof! Any function can\nbe represented as a table of values. For instance, consider a function \\( f(x) = 2x \\). The\nfollowing will be a table representation of the function.\n\\( x \\)\\( f(x) \\)\n00\n12\n24\n36\n48\n510\n612\n......\n\nLooks more like data? That's because it is the data! We have effectively generated a 2-column table\nwhere each of the cells has a certain value. Reminds of SQL tables or pandas data frames?\nNatural Results\nBecause functions are so important, there are natural results and outcomes which are shared among\nmost of functional languages.\nLet's write a Haskell function to find the factorial of a positive integer.\n-- | A function to find the factorial of a positive integer\nfactorial x = product [1..x]  -- easy as that\n\nThe function builds a list of integers from 1 up to x and then calculates the product of these\nelements. This way we effectively get a product \\( 1 \\times 2 \\times 3 .. \\times \\ x \\) which is\nthe same as \\( x! \\). Since we now have a function, we can call it with the actual parameters!\nprint (factorial 1)  -- prints out 1\nprint (factorial 6)  -- prints out 720\nprint (factorial 9)  -- prints out 362880\n\nAs shown above, something that in imperative languages would require importing modules, looping,\netc. is a single line in Haskell. This is one of the outcomes of functions being first-class\ncitizens. Most functional languages have a rich pool of built-in/predefined functions that help\nmanipulate data. In the example above, we also see a very interesting notation. Namely, [1..x]\nwhich builds up a list of integers from 1 up to \\( x \\) (\\( x \\) must also be an integer such\nthat \\( x \\geq 1 \\)). Thus, another outcome is that data structures and collections can be created\nvery easily, usually just in a single line of code, leaving more time for the programmer to deal\nwith functions and the logic. These are some of the reasons why functional languages are so concise.\nMath, Sets, and Haskell\nNotice that in the factorial function above, I excluded the case when the function is called with\n\\( 0 \\) (\\( 0! = 1 \\)). It was done on purpose so that now we are able to add some other\nnotation and explain the whole function in detail. Below is a better and more complete version of\nthe function.\n-- | A function to find the factorial of a number\nfactorial :: Integer -&gt; Integer\nfactorial 0 = 1\nfactorial x = product [1..x]\n\n:: - prompts that it is a function declaration\nInteger - type that can hold any number no matter how big, up to the limit of the machine's memory\n(so yes, this means you never have arithmetic overflows).\n-&gt; - tells either what is the type of the next formal parameter or what is the type of the output\nLooks similar to something you have seen before? If you have taken any undergraduate math class,\nthere is a big chance that you've encountered the following notation:\n\\[ f : A \\rightarrow B : x \\mapsto y \\]\nThe notation above describes/defines a simple function that takes an input from set \\( A \\) and\nmaps it to the output in the set \\( B \\).\nHere is the complete definition of the factorial function that we saw above:\n\\[ f : \\mathbb{Z}^+\\cup {0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}^+ : x \\mapsto x! \\]\nHaskell defines in the similar fashion.\nfactorial :: Integer -&gt; Integer says that factorial is a function that takes an element from the\nset of integers and maps it to some other element in the set of integers. As opposed to math,\nhowever, Haskell does not use \\( \\mapsto \\) notation and instead has the statements below it.\nfactorial 0 = 1\nfactorial x = product [1..x]\n\nThe code above is equivalent to saying that if the element is 0, map it to 1 and in all other cases,\nmap it to the product from 1 up to the element.\nState Changes and Functional Programming\nFunctional languages have a limited notion of state and typically, avoid the shared mutable state at\nany cost. Purely (see Purely Functional Languages) functional\nlanguages like Haskell, do not have any state at all. Since there are no changes in state, there are\nno variables. Instead, functional languages offer functions and immutable variables.\nTo make it clear, let's look at two examples below. One is from Python and the other is from\nHaskell.\nPython example\n# Define a variable 'my_number' and assign it to 3\nmy_number = 3\n\n# Increment the variable 'my_number' by 1 and reassign it to the result\nmy_number += 1\n\nprint(my_number)  # Prints out 4\n\nLet's repeat the same steps in Haskell.\nmyNumber = 3    -- Define a variable 'myNumber' and assign it to 3\nmyNumber += 1   -- Haskell gags here (infinite loop)\n\nprint myNumber  -- This statement is not reachable\n\nLooking at the code above, you might have already noticed that Haskell does not allow us to change\nthe state of the program. Now you might be wondering how could one increment variables.\nHere is a short answer:\nmyNumber = 3                  -- Define a variable 'myNumber' and assign it to 3\nmyOtherNumber = myNumber + 1  -- Define a variable 'myOtherNumber' and assign it to 'myNumber'\nmyNumber = myOtherNumber      -- Redefine 'myNumber' and set it to 'myOtherNumber'\nprint myNumber                -- Prints out 4\n\nLonger and better answer\n\nYou do not really need such increments or decrements in functional programming languages. You can\neasily overcome this hindrance through functions and recursion. Therefore, instead of mutating\nobjects, we use recursion to gradually get to the target.\nHere is the example of how one could translate a well-known accumulator pattern from Python to\nHaskell.\nHere is a classic Python accumulator pattern.\n# An accumulator pattern approach for finding\n# the sum of the first 100 positive integers.\n\ntotal = 0\nfor integer in range(1, 100):\n    total += integer\n\nprint(total)  # Prints out 5050\n\nHere is what it looks like in Haskell.\naccumulator 1 = 1                        -- The base case for the recursion\naccumulator x = x + accumulator (x - 1)  -- The recursive case\n\n\nmain = print (accumulator 100)  -- Prints out 5050\n\nIn the code excerpt above, we did not use any loops. In fact, we could not use any loops because\nfunctional languages do not support loops. Instead, we defined a function, used the recursion and\ncalculated the sum of the values through function calls.\nSide note\nIn this particular case, we do not even need to implement the recursive accumulator pattern. All we\nneed to do is use the already predefined sum function and so-called texas range list notation that\nwe have already seen ([1..x]).\nprint (sum [1..100])  -- Prints out 5050\nControl Flow\nAs we have already seen, there are no for loops or while loops in functional programming languages\nand there are good reasons why. Let's list a few of them and continue our discussion by elaborating\non those reasons.\n\nFunctional languages are declarative.\nMost of functional languages are heavily influenced by lambda calculus.\nIf you were to implement a functional programming language,\nyou would yourself get rid of loops.\n\n1. Functional Languages Are Declarative\nFor those who are new to the idea of declarative languages, let's first discuss what it means for a\nlanguage to be declarative. Here is a simple definition:\n\nDeclarative programming is a method to abstract away the control flow for logic required for\nperforming an action, and instead involves stating what the task or desired outcome is.\n\nThe examples of declarative languages are SQL, Haskell, Prolog etc.\nExample 1: Consider the SQL querying language. In SQL, one doesn't describe what how to get the\ndata. One just tells SQL what data is needed, and SQL engine figures out the best way to get it.\nExample 2: A better example might be comparing two implementations of a simple function. Let's\nimplement them in both Python and Haskell.\nThe function takes a list of integers and returns the sum of odd integers in it.\ndef odd_sum(list_of_integers):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of all odd integers in the list.\"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for integer in list_of_integers:\n        if integer % 2 == 1:\n            total += integer\n    return total\n\n\nprint(odd_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Prints out 9\n\nLet's do a shallow analysis of the odd_sum function. As seen above, it starts by declaring a\nvariable total which is initially set to 0. Then, we iterate over the list and through each\niteration, we check if the integer is odd and if it is, we add it to total. In the end, we return\nthe total variable.\nNow, that we have analyzed the function a bit, notice that in the for loop, through each iteration,\nwe are giving Python directions when to add the integer to total (only if it is odd). Thus, we\ntell Python what to do step-by-step. This is an important characteristic that distinguishes\nnon-declarative languages from declarative ones.\nLet's now look at the Haskell example.\noddSum x = sum (filter odd x)\n\nmain = print (oddSum [1,2,3,4,5])  -- Prints out 9\n\nNotice what we did here. First we defined a function oddSum which takes a list. Then we used the\nfunction filter (happened to be predefined) in conjunction with another predefined function odd\n(returns true if the value is odd an false otherwise) to get the list of odd integers. Finally, we\nsummed up all the odd integers and got the result.\nSee the difference? In Python, we used a for loop and through each iteration, we told Python whether\nto add the integer it to total or not. In Haskell, however, we gave a whole list to the function\nand told it to just remove all of the even integers from the list and then to sum up the rest (if\nyou eliminate all the even integers, you are obviously left with all the odd integers). In other\nwords, in the Haskell example, we do not care how the functions sum and filter work internally,\nwe only care about the fact that they do their job - sum up the odd numbers in the list and return\nthe value.\n2. Functional Programming And Lambda Calculus\n\nLambda calculus (also written as (\\( \\lambda \\)-calculus) is a branch of mathematics which was\ndeveloped by Alonzo Church in the 1930s. It is a\nformal system for expressing computation and an alternative to what's called Turing\nmachine which was introduced by Alan\nTuring. Turing machines involve loops and other\nnon-declarative approaches (Turing machines are the inspiration for programming languages like Java,\nPython, etc). A few years later, Church and Turing collaboratively wrote a paper which is now know\nas the computability thesis and proved\nthat all the computation that was done using Turing machines could effectively be done in lambda\ncalculus as well. Hence, simply put, lambda calculus has the power equivalent to that of Turing\nmachines. Not too long after, people decided to base programming languages on the ideas in lambda\ncalculus (it was just as powerful as Turing machines so why not?!). This led to shared\ncharacteristics among functional languages such as lack of loops. Virtually all functional\nprogramming languages have no loops because lambda calculus has no loops. One could certainly add\nloops, but they would have been redundant. Instead, functional languages use a mathematical idea of\nrecursion. This is the part of the reason why loops are not that appreciated in the functional\nworld.\n3. Getting Rid of Loops\n\nDespite the fact that sometimes they are very useful, loops must not be a part\nof a functional programming language. There are several reasons for this.\n\nLoops promote and advocate the idea of \"imperativeness\" (prompting the language what to do).\nLoops usually involve mutating values which is, once again, against functional virtues.\nEven if we did not use it imperatively and not mutate values, it would create unnecessary\nredundance in a language with the emphasis on recursion (which is just as powerful as a\nregular loop!)\n\nPurely Functional Languages\nYou might have seen word pure in the beginning of the blogpost where I mentioned that Haskell is\npurely functional programming language. However, I never defined what it means for a functional\nlanguage to be pure. So let's do it now!\nThose who read the Math, Sets, and Haskell, remember the math notation for\nfunctions? I will use them to take the mystery out of this concept of being pure!\nSuppose we have a function \\( f : \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\). Then by just looking at\nthe function, we see that it takes an input from a set of integers and its output is also in the set\nof integers. In other words, function \\( f \\) cannot take inputs like -1.9, 0.2, 12.7 etc. as well\nas it cannot give an output like 12.6, 71.9, -9.1 etc. Its input(s) and output(s) could\nonly be integers.\nNow, let's actually make this dull function \\( f \\) do something. Consider the function \\( f :\n\\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} : x \\mapsto 2x \\). Thus, we have a function which does a fairly\nstraightforward thing: takes an integer and maps it to twice its value (which will also be an\ninteger). Let's now look at the Haskell implementation of this function\n-- | A function that takes an input and outputs twice its value\nf :: Integer -&gt; Integer\nf x = 2 * x\n\nThe function above says that the input (corresponds to the Integer before the arrow) is always an\ninteger and the output (corresponds to the integer after the arrow) is also an integer. Hence,\nwe always know what type is the input and what type is the output. In fact, we also know that the\nif we call a function with say 5, we will always get the same result. Namely, f 5 = 10. Hence, we\ngot that input(s) and output(s) are always integers and the function called with same actual\nparameters always return the same value! This is what makes Haskell a purely functional language.\nAt any given point in time, we always know what is the type of input and what is type of output.\nBesides, we know that the function called with the same actual parameter(s), always returns the same\nvalue. Such functions virtually never produce side effects since we already know what to expect\nfor a given input. Such functions are called pure!\nTo further demystify this idea, let's look at the following piece of code from a C++ programming\nlanguage.\n/*\n * An example of a function that is pretending to be pure.\n *\n */\n\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint not_so_pure_function(int value) {\n    return value + rand() % 3;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"Returns: \" &lt;&lt; not_so_pure_function(7) &lt;&lt; endl;  // Prints out 8\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"Returns: \" &lt;&lt; not_so_pure_function(7) &lt;&lt; endl;  // Prints out 8\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"Returns: \" &lt;&lt; not_so_pure_function(7) &lt;&lt; endl;  // Prints out 7\n}\n\nHere, we defined a function that takes an integer input and it seems like the output is also an\ninteger. We now might be lured into thinking that function not_so_pure_function gives the same\noutput for the same input, but that is clearly not the case here (that is why it's called\nnot_so_pure_function). Let's take a closer look at what the function does. It takes an integer\nvalue and returns the value plus some random number which is 0, 1 or 2. When we first called the\nfunction with the actual parameter 7, we got 8 as an output. The second time, we got 8 again. The\nthird time however, we got 7. Hence, for the third time, the output was not the same. Therefore, the\nfunction is not pure.\nYou now might wondering why I could not do the same trick in Haskell. In fact, I certainly can.\nHowever, in Haskell, such function would not have a type Int. It would have a type IO Int. IO\nis usually associated with file input / output and it is reasonable that it is associated with\nfunctions that are not always \"truthful\" as File I/O could in fact be one of the nastiest\nexperiences for a programmer. So many things can go wrong! (e.g., writing to a file which was\ndeleted, reading from a file on a USB which was ejected, writing a file that was moved to some other\ndirectory etc). Thus, when we deal with uncertainty (which usually comes with side effects), Haskell\nwarns us by using the IO notation.\nHere is how not_so_pure_function could be made pure in Haskell.\n{-\nExample of a function that if called with the same argument,\ndoes not always return the same result.\n-}\n\nimport System.Random (randomRIO)\n\n\npurifiedFunction :: Int -&gt; IO Int\npurifiedFunction value = do\n    randomValue &lt;- randomRIO (0,2)\n    return (value + randomValue)\n\n\nmain = do\n    x &lt;- purifiedFunction 7\n    print x                  -- Prints out 9\n    x &lt;- purifiedFunction 7\n    print x                  -- Prints out 7\n    x &lt;- purifiedFunction 7\n    print x                  -- Prints out 9\n\nLook at the Haskell code above. You can disregard all the notational fluff. Just look at the return\ntype of the function purifiedFunction. It is IO Int! In other words, Haskell informs us that\nthe function might have side effects. This is exactly why Haskell is pure.\nFinally, we can have sort of a definition of a pure functional language.\nNOTE: Pure might mean a completely different thing in\nnon-functional languages.\n\nA functional language is pure if and only if the user is informed of all the side effects in a\nlanguage or there are no side effects at all.\n\nActually, Haskell did not allow random values back in 1990s when its development was first launched.\nBecause of this, Haskell was considered useless for all practical purposes. Eventually, developers\nand the Haskell committee decided to change the direction of Haskell. In lieu of getting rid of all\nthe side effects, they decided to control the side effects and created a more \"regulated\"\nprogramming environment.\nConclusion\nFunctional programming languages are different from imperative ones. Most of them are based on ideas\nin lambda calculus. Functional languages are the proper subset of declarative languages. There are\nno loops and recursion is used instead. Changes in state are non-existent and therefore, all the\nvariables are immutable. Functional languages have a bunch of predefined functions to make it easy\nfor a programmer to solve problems. Most of functional languages are also very concise minimizing\nthe time spent on coding and leaving more time for the logic. Pure functional languages are the\nproper subset of functional languages. Purely functional languages inform the user about the side\neffects in advance.\n\n\n\nHow to Get Started with Functional Programming?\n\nThere are a lot of functional languages. You will obviously have to decide which one to learn first.\nMy recommendation would be learning Haskell. It is a purely functional programming language which\nhas most of (if not all) the functional ideas in it. Besides, SPJ (Simon Payton\nJones) dedicates most of his time on extending\nthe language and adding new features to it. So if there is something new and interesting in the\nworld of functional programming, Haskell will probably get it (and probably sooner than other\nfunctional or imperative languages).\nAfter learning one functional language, it is fairly easy (\"easy\" is relative, but being familiar\nwith one functional language automatically makes you somewhat familiar with others) to transition to\nthe other. Hence, once you have a good grasp of functional ideas in Haskell, you can then move to\nlanguages like Clojure, Scheme, F# etc.\nTo get started, visit the Haskell documentation page which\nis full of various educational resources.\n","id":"https://www.davidoniani.com/weblog/the-essence-of-programming-functional-approach/","title":"The Essence of Programming - Functional Approach"}},"docInfo":{"https://www.davidoniani.com/":{"body":222,"title":2},"https://www.davidoniani.com/projects/":{"body":191,"title":1},"https://www.davidoniani.com/research/":{"body":226,"title":1},"https://www.davidoniani.com/weblog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://www.davidoniani.com/weblog/covid-19-and-transition-into-full-time-summer-work/":{"body":0,"title":7},"https://www.davidoniani.com/weblog/mayo-clinic-first-impressions/":{"body":0,"title":4},"https://www.davidoniani.com/weblog/privacy-for-the-web/":{"body":61,"title":2},"https://www.davidoniani.com/weblog/the-essence-of-programming-functional-approach/":{"body":2012,"title":4}},"length":8},"lang":"English"};
